You got me so wild,
How can I ever deny,
You got me so high,
So high I cannot feel the fire.
And you keep telling me,
Telling me that you'll be sweet,
And you'll never want to leave my side,
As long as I don't break these...
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself [x4]
You got me so wild,
Why should I be so surprised?
You got me so high,
Don't you see it in my eyes?
And you keep telling me,
Telling me that you'll be sweet,
And you'll never want to leave my side,
As long as I don't break these...
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself [x4]
They are so wasted on myself [x12]
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself [x4]
