Hello
You know you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips you know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals
oh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world aint for you, and I know for damn sure this world aint for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free
Ohhh
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
I know, I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they know that im not myself when your gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world, is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh
Moonshine, your lovin makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Don't look down no don't ever look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh
Moonshine, your lovin makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
