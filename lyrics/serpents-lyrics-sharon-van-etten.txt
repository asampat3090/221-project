It was a close call
Sitting in the back of the room
With a bowl you had owned,
But they didn't know.
Close in on my black eye.
I feel safe at times.
Certain emblems
Tell me it's time
Serpents in my mind
Looking for your crimes
Everything changes
I don't want mine to this time
You enjoy sucking on dreams
So I will fall asleep with someone other than you
I had a thought you would take me seriously
And listen on
Serpents in my mind
I am searching for your crimes
Everything changes
In time
You'll stay frozen in time
Collagen girls,
Controlling minds.
You hold the mirror well
To everybody else
Serpents in my mind
Trying to forgive your crimes
Everyone changes in time.
I hope he changes this time.
