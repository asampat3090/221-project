You heard my voice I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
And in the dark I have no name
So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I was sure we could see a new start
So when your hopes on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, Hold me fast
Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, Hold me fast
Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine
So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old
So when your hopes are on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
But hold me fast, Hold me fast
Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, Hold me fast
Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
The skies I'm under
