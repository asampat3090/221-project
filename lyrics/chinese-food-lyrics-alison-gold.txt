Yo!
I like Chinese food
And some Wonton soup
Get me broccoli
While I play Monopoly
Don't be a busy bee
Cause it's your fantasy
To eat Chinese food
Egg roll and Chop Suey
I use the chopsticks
To eat pot sticks
Put some hot sauce and sweet and sour make it sweet
Because Chinese food takes away my stress
Now I'm going to go eat Panda Express
