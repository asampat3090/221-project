Macklemore
hiphop
[Hook: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I, I, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fuckin awesome
[Verse One: Macklemore]
Walk in the club like what up? I got a big cock
Nah, Im just pumped up, bought some shit from the thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
People like Damn, thats a cold ass honkey
Rolling in hella, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R.Kelly sheets, piss
But shit, it was 99 cents, buy it, cop it and washing it
Bout to go and get some compliments, passing up on those moccasins
Someone else has been walking in, bummy and grungy, Fuck it
I am stunting and flossing and saving my money and I am halla happy
Thats a bargain Bitch,
Imma take your grandpa style, Imma take your grandpa style, no for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers,
dookie brown leather jacket that I found digging.
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a ski blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne aint got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like Ah, he got the Velcros
[Hook: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I, I, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up

[Verse Two: Macklemore]
What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
Im digging, Im digging, Im searching right through that luggage
One mans trash, thats another mans come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button up shirt
Cause right now, Im up in her skirt
Im at the Good will, you can find me in the bins
Im that sucker, sucker searching in the section
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
Ill take those flannel zebra jammies, second hand and Ill rock that mother fucker
The built in onsies with the socks on the mother fucker
I hit the party and they stop in that mother fucker
They be like Oh that Gucci, thats hella tight
Im like Yo, thats fifty dollars for a t-shirt
Limited edition, lets do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, thats just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business, that shirts hella don't
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand? Man you hella wont, man you hella wont
