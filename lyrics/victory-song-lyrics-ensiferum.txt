Ensiferum
metal
The plan of invasion an evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches, to slave them all
To make them kneel for a new god
The guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory Songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We re outnumbered
But our destiny is to win!
Fight! With the rage of a bear!
Defend! Our homeland!
Crush! Every enemy!
And seal our victory!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory Songs are rising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Ei urhot kaukaisen pohjolan
Uhan eess taipuneet
Jlleen pauhaa kansi taivahan
Veri valuu maahan lumiseen
Moni nhd ei saa en huomista
Moni j heit kaipaamaan
Jlkipolville j maa rauhaisa
Voiton laulut soi ainiaan
