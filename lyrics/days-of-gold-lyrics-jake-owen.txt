country
Long truck bed hop in it
Fire engine red like her lip stick
Out here we can let it go
But just me and my good friends
Jug of wine little sip
Out here baby you just never know
Yeah, these are the days of gold
Well it's a southern summer
Whisky's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beers ice cold and got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer, and that sun shining down
Like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road
These are the days of gold
A little July sky so high
Moon shine by the riverside
Stealing hearts and running wild
Yeah our own little world Tennessee
Boys and girls running free
Out here it's good time for miles
Yeah, these are the days of gold
Well it's a southern summer
Whisky's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beers ice cold and got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer, and that sun shining down
Like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road
These are the days of gold
A little bit of you, a little bit of me
What you wanna do, what's it's gonna be
We can get wild, we can live free
Or you can shake it for me baby like a Tamborine.
Slice of watermelon and you spit the seeds
Sweat on you back stickin to the seats
We can sneak off and beat the heat
I'll be buzzin' on you honey like a bumble bee
Yeah it's a southern summer
Whisky's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beers ice cold and got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer, and that sun shining down
Like Daddy's silver dollar
Gotta hop on the old dirt road
These are the days of gold
