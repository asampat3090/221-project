Have you ever?
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste?
Knock me down
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head, this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2, how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw fuck it you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste?
Knock me down
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Getting ghost in the Ghost
Can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division
Like my Maybach partition, and
God is my chauffeur
Boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi
To Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents
Turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher
I'm a motherfucking prophet, smoke a tree of knowledge
Drink from a gold chalice, you gotta love it
I arrive at the pearly gates, I had luggage
Meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste?
Heaven or Hell
The cards we been dealt
Are the cards that we play
Play, play
Die for what you believe
Only one god recedes
When the shots spray
Spray, spray
Knock me down
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste?
Knock me down
