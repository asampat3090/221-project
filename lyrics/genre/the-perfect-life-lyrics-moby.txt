Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life
is all we need
You open up when you had me in your hands
Slipping far away with the world at your command
You sing me to sleep and then you hit me awake
It's a perfect life, a perfect life
I only want to be here when you're by my side
Oh I believe now, I'll love you 'til I die
You will sing me to sleep, you will hit me awake
in the perfect life, the perfect life
Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life, life
is all we need
Little Mike he, steps everywhere
Knives in his pockets and bullets in his hair
He has nothing to live for, nothing left to say
He's locking all the doors to keep the older wolves at bay
Spoons and foil are all he needs.
A bed and some china
A lighter and some speed
It will sing you to sleep, it will hit you awake
In the perfect life, a perfect life.
(Guitar solo)
Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life, life
is all we need
Oh
It goes all night
The perfect life, life
is all we need
Oh
We close our eyes
The perfect life, life
is all we need
Oh
We close our mind
The perfect life, life
is all we need
The perfect life, the perfect life, the perfect life
all we need
