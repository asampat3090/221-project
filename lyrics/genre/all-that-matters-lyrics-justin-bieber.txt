Uh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to show me the light
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time, better believe it
Uh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
Till you back again, yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased
To my significant other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
But the next eight bars will tell you why
You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, ain't worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, what's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Take the gas out the car it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you, and only you
Uh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart please believe
You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, ain't worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, what's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
