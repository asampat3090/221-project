Elsa was an acrobat
That went and fell in love with that
Horatio, the human cannonball
A wedding beneath the big top tent
With barkers, clowns, and elephants,
Sideshow family oddities and all
The dogface boy
Howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was cryin'
Ever since the beginning
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
Thomas was a congressman
with closet's full of skeletons
And dresses that he wore on Friday nights
Phyllis was a pharmacist
A dab of that a pinch of this
Concocted to suppress her appetite
When the children were fiddlin'
She'd slip them some Ritalin
And wait for Thomasina to arrive
Cuz ever since the beginning
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
When I play this old guitar
At children's shows to smoky bars
I take a break and think about the past
When I stood up in geometry
And everybody stared at me
And I tossed my test into the trash
I scratched off my number
While hitching out under
That Bushleague population sign
Ever since the beginning
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
At some point the finger
Let ignorance linger
If they'd look in a mirror they'd find
That ever since the beginning
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
Yeah yeah
Oh yeah
