I drink to remember, I smoke to forget
Some things to be proud of, some stuff to regret
Run down some dark alleys in my own head
Something is changing, changing, changing
I go back to Clifton to see my old friends
The best people I could ever have met
Skin up a fat one, hide from the Feds
Something is changing, changing, changing
So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
I got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm here to stay
So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
I got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm here to stay
Down in the kitchen, drinking white lightning
He's with my mumma, yelling and fighting
It's not the first time praying for silence
Something is changing, changing, changing
So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
I got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm here to stay
So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
I got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm here to stay
There's a story for every corner of this place
Running so hard you got out but your knees got grazed
I'm an old dog but I learned some new tricks yeah
So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain
Light a cigarette and wish the world away
I got out I got out I'm alive and I'm here to stay
So I hold two fingers up to yesterday
Light a cigarette and smoke it all away
I got out I got out I'm alive and I'm here to stay
Hey, hey it's fine
Hey, hey it's fine
Hey, hey it's fine
I left it behind
