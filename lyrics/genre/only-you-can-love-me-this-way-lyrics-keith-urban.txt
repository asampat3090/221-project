Well, I know there's a reason
And I know there's a rhyme
We were meant to be together
And that's why
We can roll with the punches
We can stroll hand in hand
And when I say it's forever
You understand
That you're always in my heart
You're always on my mind
But when it all becomes too much
You're never far behind
And there's no one
That comes close to you
Could ever take your place
'Cause only you can love me this way
I could have turned a different corner
I could have gone another place
Then I'd of never had this feeling
That I feel today, yeah
And you're always in my heart
Always on my mind
When it all becomes too much
You're never far behind
And there's no one
That comes close to you
Could ever take your place
'Cause only you can love me this way
Ooh
And you're always in my heart
You're always on my mind
And when it all becomes too much
You're never far behind
And there's no one
That comes close to you
Could ever take your place
'Cause only you can love me this way
Ooh
Only you can love me this way
