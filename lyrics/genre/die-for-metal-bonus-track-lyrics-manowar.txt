Manowar
metal
They cant stop us
Let em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
and the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
and called me brother said my friends
are over there
They call themselves immortals
Theyre the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They cant stop us
Let em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, theres a battle on
Know my words are true
Theres a battle for true metal
Theyre marching; theyre marching on
me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metals calling you
Its everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They cant stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
