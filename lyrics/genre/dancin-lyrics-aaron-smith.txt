Get up on the floor,
Dancin' all night long,
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' till the break of dawn,
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' till the break of dawn,
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' till the break of, dancin'
All the time,
My baby you on my mind,
And I don't know why,
Yeah but the feeling is fine,
Can't you see,
Honey you are for me,
Though it weren't meant to be
Dancin' in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright,
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight
Everytime when I look in your eyes
That smile was crying that you were mine
Do you know, your love is true I know,
You are the best thing that has happened to me
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' all night long,
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' till the break of dawn,
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' till the break of dawn,
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' till the break of, dancin'
[Chorus: (x3)]
Dancin' is what to do,
Dancin's when I think of you,
Dancin's what clears my soul,
Dancin's what makes me whole
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' all night long,
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' till the break of dawn,
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' till the break of dawn,
Get up on the floor,
Dancin' till the break of, dancin'
