I want your love
Love, love, love I want your love
I want your dram
The touch of your hand
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love I want your love
(Love, love, love I want your love)
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, your bad romance
I want your love and
I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

All your lover's revenge

Want you in my rear window
Baby your sick
I want your love
Love, love, love
I want your love
(Love, love, love I want your love)
You know that I want you
('Cause I'm a freak bitch baby!)
And you know that I need you
I want a bad, bad romance
