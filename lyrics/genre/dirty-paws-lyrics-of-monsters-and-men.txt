Jumping up and down the floor,
My head is an animal.
And once there was an animal;
It had a son that mowed the lawn.
The son was an okay guy.
They had a pet dragonfly.
The dragonfly it ran away,
But it came back with a story to say.
[Hey]
[Hey] Her dirty paws and furry coat,
She ran down the forest slopes.
The forest of talking trees;
They used to sing about the birds and the bees.
The bees had declared a war;
The sky wasn't big enough for them all.
The birds, they got help from below,
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow.
[La, la, la,
La, la, la, la.
La, la, la,
La, la, la, la.]
[Hey]
[Hey] And for a while things were cold;
They were scared down in their homes.
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines.
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes,
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws.
