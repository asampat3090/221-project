country
Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Daddy was mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister
She prayed blow it down
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
[Chorus]
Shatter every window till it's all blown away,
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Till there's nothing left standing,
Nothing left to yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,
She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge
[Chorus]
Shatter every window till it's all blown away,
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Till there's nothing left standing,
Nothing left to yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,
Blown away
[Outro]
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
Shatter every window till it's all blown away,
(Blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
(Blown away)
Till there's nothing left standing,
Nothing left to yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,
Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away
