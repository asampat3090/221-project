blues
I'm your mamma, I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your doctor when in need
Want some coke, have some weed
You know me, I'm your friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Ain't I clean? Bad machine
Super cool, super mean
Feelin' good, for the man
Superfly, here I stand
Secret stash, heavy bread
Baddest bitches in the bed
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Solid life of crime
A man of odd circumstance
A victim of ghetto demands
Feed me money for style
And I'll let you trip for a while
Insecure from the past
How long can a good thing last?
Woo-hoo, no
Got to be mellow, y'all
Gotta get mellow now
Pusherman gettin' mellow y'all
Heavy mind have you signed?
Makin' money all the time
My LD entrusts me
For all junkies to see
Ghetto prince is my thing
Makin' love's how I swing
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Too bad, splee for a generous fee
Make your world what you want it to be
Got a woman I love desperately
Wanna give her somethin' better than me
Been told I can't be nothin' else
Just a hustler in spite of myself
I know I can rake it, this life just don't make it
Lord, lord
Got to get mellow now
Gotta be mellow, y'all
Got to get mellow now
I'm your mamma, I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your doctor when in need
Want some coke, have some weed
You know me, I'm your friend
Your man boy, thick and thin
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
I'm your pusherman
Pusherman
Lord, Lord
