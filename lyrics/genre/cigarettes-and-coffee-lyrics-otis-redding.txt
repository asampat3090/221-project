blues
It's early in the morning
About a quarter till three
I'm sitting' here talkin' with my baby
Over cigarettes and coffee, now
And to tell you that
Darling, I've been so satisfied
Honey, since I met you
Baby, since I met you, oh
All the places that I've been around
And all the good looking girls I've met
They just don't seem to fit in
Knowing this particularly sad, yeah
But it seemed so natural, darling
That you and I are here
Just talking over cigarettes
And drinking coffee, oh
And whole my heart cries out
Love at last I've found you
And honey, won't you let me
Just be my whole life around you
And while I complete, I complete my whole life would be, yeah
If you would take things under consideration
And walk down this hour with me
I would love it, yeah
People I say it's so early in the morning
Ooh, it's a quarter till three
We're sittin' here talkin'
Over cigarettes and drinkin' coffee, now, Lord
And I'll like to show you, well
I've known nothing but good old joy
Since I met you, darling
Honey, since I've met you, baby yeah
I would love to have another drink of coffee now
And please, darling, help me smoke this one more cigarette now
I don't want no cream and sugar
'Cause I've got you, now darling
But just let me enjoy
Help me to enjoy
This good time that we'll have, baby
It's so early, so early in the morning
So early, so early in the morning
And I've got you and you've got me
And we'll have each other
And we don't, we don't want nothing but joy
