As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
[Verse 1]
Girl we're under pressure,
seven billion people in the world trying to fit in.
Keep it together,
smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl,
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
[Verse 2]
I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for your dreams girl
I'll be your Hova, you can be my Destiny's Child on a scene girl
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand
[Bridge]
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
[Big Sean]
Yo,B.I.G
I don't know if this makes sense but,you're my Hallelujah
Give me a time and place,I'll rendezvous it,i'll fly you to it,
I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...
A couple of things I can't spell without you
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's is our point of view
Man now we stepping out like Whoa! (Oh God)
Camera's point and shoot,
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you you you
The one that I've argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bother with,
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
It's green where you water it
So I know,we got issues baby true true true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Then go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me
[Chorus]
As you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
i'll be your silver, i'll be your gold
love me, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love me
