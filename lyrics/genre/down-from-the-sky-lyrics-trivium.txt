Trivium
metal
A chasm grows
With the cavity of serpentine teeth
(Serpentine teeth)
Hunger pangs strike
For the sweet feast of innocent blood
Of innocent bloodshed
Now here we go
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire
I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Fire rains down from the sky
The gaping wounds
Hemorrhaging the blood from which they feast
(Blood from which they feast)
Eat us alive
Consume to feed a hunger with no
A hunger with no end
Let's fucking go
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire
I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Fire rains down from the sky
This battle's not the same
Which they have led us to believe
A synthesis of propaganda
Terror and deceit
We are the cattle
They the slaughter
Our meat: gasoline
They pump us through the machine's valves
To cleanse the world's disease
We are the ammunition
That will cause all life to cease
Annihilate
All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They'll rain their holocaust
Down from the sky
(Lead - Matt)
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
(Lead - Corey)
Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire
I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Fire rains down from the sky
Annihilate
All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They'll rain their holocaust
Down from the sky...
