Sha la la la la, sha la la la la
You used to call me your angel
Said I was sent straight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your arms
I love the way you felt so strong
I never want you to leave
I want you to stay here holdin' me
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here some how
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha la la la la
I miss you
You used to call me your dreamer
And now I'm livin' out my dream
Oh, how I wish you could see
everything that's happening for me
I'm thinkin' back on the past
It's true the time is flyin' by too fast
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here some how
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha la la la la
I miss you
I know you're in a better place yeah
But I wish that I could see your face, oh
I know you're where you need to be
Even though it's not here with me
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha la la la la
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha la la la la
I miss you...
