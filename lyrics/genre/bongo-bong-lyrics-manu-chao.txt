Mama was queen of the mambo, papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in the jungle, I started bangin' my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be in my place instead of me
'Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby, I'm the king of bongo bong
I went to the big town where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Looking for a bigger crown
So I play my boogie for the people of big city
But they don't go crazy when I'm bangin' in my boogie
I'm the, king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
They say that I'm a clown
Making too much dirty sound
They say there is no place for little monkey in this town
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie
I'm the, king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Bangin' on my bongo all that swing belongs to me
I'm so happy there's nobody in my place instead of me
I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town
But I'm the king of bongo baby, I'm the king of bongo bong
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
