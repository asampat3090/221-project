Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head telling me that we're no good
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
Tomorrow I'll be stronger
I'm not gonna break down and call you up when my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
But when I pass your house, I won't stop no matter how bad I want to
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow
Baby when we're good, you know we're great
But there's too much bad for us to think
That there's anything worth trying to save
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you, you're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
