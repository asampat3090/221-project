blues
I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back these feeling for so long
And if you feel, like I feel baby
Then come on, oh come on
Let's get it on, oh baby
Lets get it on, let's love baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on, woah
We're all sensitive people
With so much to give, understand me sugar
Since we got to be
Let's say, I love you
There's nothin' wrong with me
Lovin' you, baby love, love
And givin' yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby
Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be?
I'm askin' you baby to get it on with me, ooo ooo
I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push
I won't push you baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Stop beatin' round the bush, hey
Let's get it on, let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Come on baby, let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on, let's get it on baby
This minute, oh yeah let's get it on
Please, let's get it on
I know you know what I been dreamin' of, don't you baby?
My whole body makes that feelin' of love, I'm happy

I won't push you baby, woo
Come on, come on, come on, come on darling
Stop beatin' round the bush, hey
