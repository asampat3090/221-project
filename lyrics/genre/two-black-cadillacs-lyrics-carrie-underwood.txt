Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
Ones for his wife,
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didnt bother to cry
(Bye bye,bye bye)
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
Hes not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye bye,bye bye bye
(Two black cadillacs, two black cadillacs)
Two months ago his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then hed never get away with doing this to them
Two black cadillacs waiting for the right time, right time
(Bye bye,bye bye,bye bye
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didnt bother to cry
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
Hes not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye,bye bye,bye bye
Yeah yeah
It was the first time and last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didnt bother to cry
(Bye bye bye bye)
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
Hes not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
