Helloween
metal
No fear, no pain, nobody left to blame
I'll try alone make destiny my own
I learn to free my mind myself I now must find
Once more, once more
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall, I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail to the heavens, I sail if I could fly
So here I am in solitude I stand
I've got dreams inside I need to realize
My faith has grown no fear of the unknown
No more, no more
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall, I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail I could ravage my jail, if I could fly
If I could, if I could fly
If I could, if I could fly, if I could
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall, I would picture it all
If I could fly see the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail to the heavens I sail
If I could fly like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall, I would picture it all If I could fly
See the world through my eyes would not stumble nor fail
I could ravage my jail, if I could fly
