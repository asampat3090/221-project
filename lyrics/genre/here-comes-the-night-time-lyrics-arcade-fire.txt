When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down, you head inside
Cause the lights don't work
Yeah nothing works- they say you don't mind
[Chorus]
But here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
And the missionaries
They tell us we will be left behind
Been left behind
A thousand times, a thousand times
If you want to be righteous
If you want to be righteous, get in line
Cause here comes the night time
[Chorus]
They say heaven's a place
Yeah, heaven's a place and they know where it is
But you know where it is?
It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
And when they hear the beat, coming from the street, they lock the door
But if there's no music up in heaven, then what's it for?
When I hear the beat, the spirit's on like a live-wire
A thousand horses running wild in a city on fire
It starts in your feet, then it goes to your head
And if you can't feel it, then the rules are dead
And if you're the judge, what is our crime?
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
[Chorus]
Now the preachers they talk up on the satellite
If you're looking for Hell, just try looking inside
[Chorus]
When you look in the sky, just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
When you look in the sky, just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
Here comes the night time
