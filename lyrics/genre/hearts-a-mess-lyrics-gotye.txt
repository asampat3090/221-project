Gotye
alternative
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this
You have lost
Too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust
(It's not enough)
You just threw away the key
To your heart
You don't get burned
('Cause nothing gets through)
It makes it easier
(Easier on you)
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see...
Love ain't fair
So there you are
My love
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But i'm desperate to connect
And you, you cant't live like this
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But i'm desperate to connect
And you, you cant't live like this
Love ain't safe
You won't get hurt if you stay chaste
So you can wait
But I don't wanna waste my love
