If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
'Cause, baby, my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy, no, no
If you are serious, look, girl, look, girl, look, girl
Then don't play with my heart
It makes me furious, hmm
Oh, but if you want me to love you
Then, baby, I will, girl, you know that I will
Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed, let your conscience be your guide
But I, lord, I know deep down inside of me
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride, hmm
You know life is too short, lord
To have sorrow, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You may be here today, oh, my darlin', my darlin'
You may gone tomorrow
So you might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby, baby, baby, baby, go on and live
Tell it like it is
I'm nothin' to play with, girl, you better find yourself a toy
But I know deep down inside me
I believe you love me but I'm not your little boy, no
Tell it like it is, oh I love, oh I love, oh I love
Oh how I love, my darlin', my darlin'
There is nothin' I can do about it, oh
