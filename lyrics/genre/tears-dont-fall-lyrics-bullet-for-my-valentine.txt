Bullet%20For%20My%20Valentine
metal
Let's go
With blood shot eyes I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
The moments die, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Ow yeah
This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end? I'm hoping
My world is over one more time
Let's go
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
