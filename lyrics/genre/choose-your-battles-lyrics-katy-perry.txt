You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tip toe through your triggered mine
You fight me but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating
Why you trying to make me your enemy
All I really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby why the ammunition
I don't wanna be the last one standing
Choose your battles, babe
Then you win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore
I try to pick off your red flags
But dancing up on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
Feel cursed just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees, defeated
Now retreated
Why you trying to make me your enemy
All I really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby why the ammunition
I don't wanna be the last one standing
Choose your battles, babe
Then you win the war
Stop digging your own grave
Within, so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
I don't wanna fight no more
Anyway, I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
(Stop digging your own grave
Within, so much to live for)
Choose your battles, babe
Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore
Anyway, I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
