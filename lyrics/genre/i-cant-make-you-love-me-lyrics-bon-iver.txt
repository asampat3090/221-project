Turn down the lights,
Turn down the bed,
Turn down these voices, inside my head.
Lay down with me,
Tell me no lies,
Just hold me close, don't patronize me
Don't patronize me.
Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something it won't
Here in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I feel the power but you don't
No, you don't
Cause I can't make you love me, If you don't.
If you don't,
No you won't,
I close my eyes
I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
I feel the power but you don't
No you don't
I can't make you love me if you don't
If you don't,
No, no, no, you won't
I found love darling,
I found love darling,
I found love darling,
I found love darling, yeah
I found love darling, darling, darling
Love in the nick of time
I found love darling, yeah
Love in the nick of time
