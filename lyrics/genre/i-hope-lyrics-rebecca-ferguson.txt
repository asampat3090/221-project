I used to hate you so easily
Look into your eyes so eagerly
And whether is cold
I wouldn't walk away
'Cause when there's money love is blind
He's so blind
But after a time
I realized that for me to grow
I've got to let go
I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well
I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she's kind
I hope that she's kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
'Cause after a time you realise that it ain't easy
'Cause after a time you realise that you should've believed in me
I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
Loving ourselves comes so easily
Forgiven her was like the biggest sin to me
And where there was war
I wouldn't walk away
But after a time
I realized that for me to grow
I've got to let go
I hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope life treats you well
I hope she treats you well
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
I hope that she's kind
I hope that she's kind
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
Hope life treats you good
I hope life treats you good
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope
Used to hate you so easily
Look into those eyes so eagerly
And where there was cold
I wouldn't walk away
