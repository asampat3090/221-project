Well, I've been down to Georgia, I've seen the streets in the West
I've driven down the 90, hell, I've seen America's best
I've been through the Rockies, well, I've seen Saskatoon
I've driven down the Highway 1, just hopin' that I'd see you soon
'Cause I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home, comin' home
I've never been to Alaska but I can tell you this
I've been to Lincoln, Nebraska and hell, you know it ain't worth shit
I've been through Nova Scotia, Sydney to Halifax
But I'll never take any pictures 'cause I know I'll just be right back
'Cause I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home, comin' home
Well, I've seen a palace in London, I've seen a castle in Wales
But I'd rather wake up beside you and breathe that old familiar smell
I never thought you could leave me, I figured I was the one
But I understand your sadness, so I guess I should just hold my tongue
But I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
Comin' home, I'm comin' home, comin' home
I know that we're takin' chances, you told me life was a risk
I just have one last question, will it be my heart or will it be his?
Comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home, comin' home, I'm comin' home
