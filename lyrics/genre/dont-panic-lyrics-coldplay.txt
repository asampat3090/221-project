Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for
We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do
Yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world
Bones sinking like stones
All that we've fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for
We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do
Yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world
We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do
Yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world
Oh all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
Cause here
Everybody here's got somebody to lean on
