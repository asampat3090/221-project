Take the makeup
Off your eyes
I've got to see you
Hear your sacred sighs
Before the breakup
Comes the silence
I'm talking to you
You say you're over it
But I know…
I thought I knew you,
You thought you knew me.
But now that you do,
It's not so easy now,
That I know.
You can cry; I won't go.
You can scream I won't go.
Every man that you know
Would have run at the word go.
Little boys with their porno,
Oh, I know they hurt you so.
They don't know what we know.
Never know what we know.
And all your makeup,
Just take it off.
I've got to find you
Before the line is lost.
I know I hurt you,
I won't deny it.
When I reach for you,
You say, "I'm over it."
But I know…
You can cry; I won't go.
You can scream I won't go.
Every man that you know
Would have run at the word go.
Little boys with their porno,
Oh, I know they hurt you so.
They don't know what I know.
It's so little that we know,
But the cup it over flows.
Little boys with their porno,
This is their world, where can we go?
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me.
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me.
Can you see me?
You can cry; I won't go.
You can scream I won't go.
Little boys with their porno.
Little boys with their porno.
Makes me feel like something's wrong.
It's the only world we know.
Yeah, something's wrong.
Little boys with their porno.
And boys they learn
Some selfish shit
Until the girl
Won't put up with it.
On and on and on we go.
I just have to know.
I'm not over it.
I'm not over it.
You say love is real
Like a disease.
Come on tell me please,
I'm not over it.
I'm not over it.
Wait…
