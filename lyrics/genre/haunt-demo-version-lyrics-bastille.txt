We'll make our agreements,
About when to meet,
And I'll leave you in the doorway,
The cold evening aches,
As it leaves in its wake,
All the memories left by the day,
And I'm questioning why,
As you look to the sky,
That is cloudless up above our heads,
And thoughts come to mind,
that our short little lives,
Haven't left the path that they will tread,
They will tread,
I'll come back to haunt you,
Memories will taunt you,
And I will try to love you,
It's not like I'm above you,
The wisdom we learn
as our minds, they do burn'll,
Entice the naivety in youth,
As adults will grow and maturity shows,
The terrifying rarity of truth,
As you turn to your mind,
And your thoughts they rewind,
To old happenings and things that are done,
You can't find what's passed,
Make that happiness last,
Seeing from those eyes what you've become,
What you've become,
I'll come back to haunt you,
Memories will taunt you,
And I will try to love you,
It's not like I'm above you,
I will see you there,
See you there,
See you there,
I'll come back to haunt you,
Memories will taunt you,
And I will try to love you,
It's not like I'm above you
