Bullet%20For%20My%20Valentine
metal
Am I going insane?
My blood is boiling inside of my veins
An evil feeling attacks
My body's shaking, there's no turning back
Don't take your eyes off the trigger
I'm not to blame if your world turns to black
As your eyes start to blister
There's just no hope for a final embrace
So here we are, I'm in your head
I'm in your heart
You were told to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal
I was told to stay away
Those two words, I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal
Is it my turn to die?
My heart is pounding as I say goodbye
So now I dance in the flames
I love you crying and screaming my name
You said that we'd be forever
How could you kill me and lie to my face?
Now that we can't be together
There's just no hope for a final embrace
So here we are, I'm in your head
I'm in your heart
You were told to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal
I was told to stay away
Those two words, I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal, go
So here we are, I'm in your head
I'm in your heart
You were told to run away
Soak the place and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal
I was told to stay away
Those two words, I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal
