Come along it is the break of day
Surely now, you'll have some things to say
It's not the time for telling tales on me
So come along, it won't be long 'til we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies in this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt, tomorrow we'll be free
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
Well, it's been rough but we'll be just fine
We'll work it out, yeah, we'll survive
You mustn't let a few bad times dictate
So come along, it won't be long 'til we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies in this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt, tomorrow we'll be free
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
Let's not fight
