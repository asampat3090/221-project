pop
I can tell you wanna drink girl
You ain't gotta worry no more
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em
As soon as I walk in the door
These dudes don't know me from Adam and Eve
That's why they can't mess up my flow
And when this beat drops, your heart stops
You feel it from your head to your toes
If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl, that's what I'm talking 'bout
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off
I know a little girly from uptown
Just waiting just to cater to me
I know a little Betty from downtown
That'll do anything that I please
All my other people that dance 'round
When they hear me rocking the groove
Now it might sound cocky
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true?
If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl, that's what I'm talking 'bout
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Now break it down
Now move a little bit to the left
Now move back over here to the right
Let me see you walk, walk, yeah
Let me see you walk, here comes your part, girl
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off
