Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or waterfall could stall me
And then came the rush of the flood
The stars at night turned deep to dust
Melt me down into big black armor
Leave no trace of grace just in your honor
Lower me down to culprit south
Make 'em wash a space in town
For the lead and the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping
Lower me down, pin me in
Secure the grounds for the later parade
Once I wanted to be the greatest
Two fists of solid rock
With brains that could explain
Any feeling
Lower me down, pin me in
Secure the grounds
For the lead and the dregs of my bed
I've been sleeping for the later parade
Once I wanted to be the greatest
No wind or water fall could stall me
And then came the rush of the flood
The stars at night turned deep to dust
