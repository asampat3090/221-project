Trapped in a prism, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre les royaumes, des vivants et des morts.
If this is heaven
I don't know what it's for
If I can't find you there
I don't care
I thought, I found a way to enter
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought, I found the connector
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're still connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And I was staring at a screen
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre les voyants, les vivants et les morts.
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
'Cause you're my home
I thought, I found a way to enter
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought, I found the connector
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor) Just a Reflektor
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
(Just a Reflektor) just a Reflektor
(Just a Reflektor) just a Reflektor (Reflektor)
(Just a Reflektor)
(Just a Reflektor)
(Just a Reflektor, just a Reflektor)
(Just a Reflektor, just a Reflektor)
Just a reflection, of a reflection
Of a reflection, of a reflection, of a reflection
Will I see you on the other side? (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
It's just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection, of a reflection, of a reflection
Will I see you on the other side? (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
Alright, let's go back
Our song escapes, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me?
Down, down, down, don't mess around
I thought, I found a way to enter
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought, I found the connector
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It's just a Reflektor
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Thought you would bring me to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Thought you would bring to me the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Thought you would bring to me the resurrector
Turns out you were just a Reflektor
It's just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
(It's just a Reflektor) Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
Will I see you on the other side?
It's just a Reflektor
Will I see you on the other side? (Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
Will I see you on the other side?
