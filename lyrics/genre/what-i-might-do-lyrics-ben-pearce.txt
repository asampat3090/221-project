I knew just what I had to be
When I heard you say what you said to me
To every dude in sight
Look like you working up an appetite for the night, check it
By then I just sat at the back
Peeping you out, the way you act
It was drinking time, getting out of line
And I'm taking you back at your place
All is well and all is cool
Stay in your place, don't be no fool
We'll get along alright
You look like the type that would try to fight
Best off being a friend to me
You don't want to offend me
Better play it cool, don't know what I might do

I knew just what I had to be
When I heard you say what you said to me, baby girl
Appetite for the night, check it
I knew just what I had to be
When I heard you say what you said to me, baby girl
I knew just what I had to be
When I heard you say what you said to me, baby girl
Appetite for the night, check it
I knew just what I had to be
When I heard you say what you said to me, baby girl
