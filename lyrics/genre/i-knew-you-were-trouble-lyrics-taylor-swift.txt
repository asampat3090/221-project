(Verse 1)
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
(Pre-Chorus)
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize, the blame is on me
(Chorus)
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
(Verse 2)
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
Now I see, Now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e
(Pre-Chorus)
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize the joke is on me
Hey!
(Chorus)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, Oh, , trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, Oh, , trouble, trouble, trouble
(Bridge)
And the saddest fear...
Comes creeping in...
That you never loved me... or her or anyone or anything
Yeah!
(Chorus)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, Oh, , trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, Oh, , trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble!
