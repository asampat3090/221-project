I don't want another piece of your mind
So take it somewhere else for the night
'Cause I can't take another goodbye
If you wanna fight, bite your tongue
Before you explode
But don't let this get out of control
You don't want me to leave you alone
When somebody loves somebody
That's the way it's supposed to be
'Cause you know nobody else would put up with your games, oh
I don't believe you love if you don't wanna go , no
That's not the way it is when somebody loves somebody
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
When somebody loves somebody
Wait, I'm hearing every word that you say
You wonder if you made a mistake
It's written all over your face
You know it's too late
We've already fallen in love
Tell me, is it asking too much
For you to stick it out when it's tough
Is it ever enough?
When somebody loves somebody
That's the way it's supposed to be
'Cause you know nobody else would put up with your games, oh
I don't believe you love if you don't wanna go, no
That's not the way it is when somebody loves somebody
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
When somebody loves somebody
Some people live their lives
Never believing in love
I don't want that for us
When somebody loves somebody
That's the way it's supposed to be
'Cause you know nobody else would put up with your games, oh
I don't believe you love if you don't wanna go, no
That's not the way it is when somebody loves somebody
Eh, eh, eh, eh...
When somebody loves somebody
