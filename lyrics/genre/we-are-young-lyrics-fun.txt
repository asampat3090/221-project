Fun.
rock
Give me a second I
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me
Just across the bar
My seats been taken by some sunglasses
Asking 'bout a scar
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
we can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I
I just thought maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
Cause I found someone to carry me home
Tonight
We are young
So let's the set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
The world is on my side nanananannanana
I have no reason to run anananananananan
So will someone come and carry me home tonight nananananana
The angels never arrived nananananananan
But I can hear the choir nanannananananan
So will someone come and carry me home anananana
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight
