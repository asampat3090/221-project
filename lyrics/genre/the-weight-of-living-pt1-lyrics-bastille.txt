Bastille
alternative
There's an albatross around your neck,
All the things you've said,
and the things you've done,
Can you carry it with no regrets,
Can you stand the person you've become,
Ooh there's a light (x2)
CHORUS
Your Albatross, let it go, let it go,
Your Albatross shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake
The heavy weight of living
Stepping forward out into the day
Shrugging off the dust and memory
Though it's soaring still above your head
It is out of sight and none shall see
Oooh there's a light (x2)
CHORUS
Your Albatross, let it go, let it go,
Your Albatross shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake
The heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake
The weight of Living
It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes (x4)
CHORUS
Your Albatross, let it go, let it go,
Your Albatross shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake
The heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake
The weight of Living
The Weight of Living (x4)
