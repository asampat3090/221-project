Birdy
indie
I find shelter in this way
Under cover, hide away
Can you hear when I say
I have never felt this way
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on
Can I be, was I there
It felt so crystal in the air
I still want to drown whenever you leave
Please teach me gently how to breathe
And I'll cross oceans like never before
So you can feel the way I feel it too
And I'll send images back at you
So you can see the way I feel it too
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on
