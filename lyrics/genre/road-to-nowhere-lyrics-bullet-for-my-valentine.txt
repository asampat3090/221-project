Bullet%20For%20My%20Valentine
metal
Tired and lonely still we stand
On a road to nowhere
Trapped in a world of endless days,
My engine's stalling (Road to nowhere)
Body and mind are breaking down
On a road to nowhere
Destiny silent, hear no sound
As I wait forever.
Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
Feelings have failed me
Left me cold
On this road to nowhere
(Road to Nowhere)
Dreams are my saviors,
Save me now,
'Cause I know I'm fallin' (Oh yes)
Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
Candles burn slowly,
Flames shine so brightly
Light in the darkness,
Save me from madness again
Only the lonely,
could possibly know me
Heat keeps on rising,
Fire engulfs me again
KEEPS ON RISING
Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
