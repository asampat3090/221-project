Bullet%20For%20My%20Valentine
metal
There goes my valentine again
Soaked in red for what she said
And now she's gone
Oh, my God, have I done it again?
There's a pulse and it's deafening
I can't help what I hear in my head
It's the switch that I flick when he says
Hand of blood, I don't wanna feel
My heart is breaking
Hand of blood, I don't wanna see
My life is burning
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
I saw you run, I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?
There's a stain on my hand and it's red
Oh, my God, am I losing it?
I can't help what I've done or I've said
It's the buttons I push when he says
Hand of blood, I don't wanna feel
My heart is breaking
Hand of blood, I don't wanna see
My life is burning
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
I saw you run, I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?
I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
I saw you run, I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?
