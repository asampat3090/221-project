You say you want your own life well I do, too
You wanna' lead me all night well I'll show you
C'mon girls march it out show him what you're all about it
Whoopin' the house down, show him who's the leader
Bring ya' baby down, down
Go cheerleader
Baby, I'm a gangsta too and it takes two to tango
You don't wanna' dance with me, dance with me
Honey, I'm in love with you if you don't feel the same,
Boy, you don't wanna' mess with me, mess with me
