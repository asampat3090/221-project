1, 2, 3!
Everybody come on, off your seats
I'm gonna tell you about a beat
That's gonna make you move your feet
I'll give the barbeque
Show and tell you how to move
If you're 5 or 82
This is something you can do
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Country fivin', hip hop hip
Put your hands in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, slide
Come on it's fun,
Ok, one more time
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Country fivin', hip hop hip
Put your hands in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, Slide
Zig zag 'cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist
And then a zig zag, step, slide
Lean in left, clap three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
We get to four, five, six
And you're feelin' busted
But it's not time to quit
Practice makes you perfect
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Country fivin', hip hop hip
Put your arms in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, Slide
Zig zag 'cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist
And then a zig zag, step, slide
Lean in left, clap three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
Boom de clap de clap, boom boom clap
Come on, here we go!
Boom boom clap, boom de clap de clap
Boom boom clap, boom de clap
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Country fivin', hip hop hip
Put your arms in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, Slide
Zig zag 'cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist
And then a zig zag, step, slide
Lean in left, clap three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Do the hoedown
(Throwdown!)
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
Boom dap clap, b-boom de clap clap clap
Boom dap clap, b-boom de clap clap
Boom de clap, boom de clap de clap
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
