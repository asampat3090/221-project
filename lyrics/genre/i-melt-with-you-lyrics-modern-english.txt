Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world thrashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace
I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(You should know better)
Dream of better lives the kind which never hate
(You should see why)
Dropped in the state of imaginary grace
(You should know better)
I made a pilgrimage to save this humans race
(You should see why)
What I'm comprehending a race that long gone bye
(I'll stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
(I'll stop the world) you've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
(Let's stop the world) there's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
The future's open wide
(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world) I've seen some changes but it's getting better all the time
(Let's stop the world) there's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
The future's open wide
Hmmm hmmm hmmm

I'll stop the world and melt with you (let's stop the world)
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time (let's stop the world)
