All winter we got carried away
Over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer we just hurried
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry
Try
Try
Try

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
I don't want to cycle or recycle revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends
No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
I don't want to cycle or recycle revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends
And in the end
We lie awake and we dream of making our escape
And in the end
We lie awake and we dream of making our escape
