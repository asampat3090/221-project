It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time, time will reveal, yeah
One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one, yeah yeah
It's so incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional once you know what it's all about, hey
And undesirable for us to be apart
I never would've made it very far
'Cause you know you got the keys to my heart
'Cause, one, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one
Say farewell to the dark of night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time
One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one
