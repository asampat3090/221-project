And so it is
Just like you said, it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is, he has
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
And so it is, he has
Just like you said, it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is, he has
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes
Did I say that I loathe you?
Did I say, you better want to
Leave it all behind?
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind
My mind, my mind
'Til I find somebody
