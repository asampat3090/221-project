Eminem
hiphop
Young Money, yeah
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open bibles
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make you beg
Bitches, try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
Ok, you want me up in the cage then I'll come out in beast-mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood Gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say, just
Don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And you don't hurt me
You don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love, no love
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love
And I don't need you no more
Get 'em
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin
To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fixin' to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat them, so why the fuck would I join them when I beat them?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah, the rap was tight
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game, I self-started a Roc fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm staying on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say, just
Don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And you don't hurt me
You don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love, no love
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love
And I don't need you no more
Bitch, you get no love
