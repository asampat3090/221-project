I love you
And everything about you
Won't you stay away
So I can get my work done in the day, Okay
And maybe in the meantime,
You and me will be fine
If you just relax
And check your eyes for cataracts
Its plain to see
That I was meant for you and you were meant for me
Darling hold me tightly,
I think you and me we might be
Falling, Falling, Falling, I'm falling
In love
Drama queen,
Like when you see a fire
You grab the gasoline
Now honey please calm down,
Yes don't make a scene
They're asking us to leave now,
I'm calling the police
Yes he's a manly man
Cause you're defending me just like a punching bag
But I can take a punch
If you can take a jab
You catch me when I fall
And dress your wounds with alcohol
Im falling, falling , falling, I'm falling
In love
