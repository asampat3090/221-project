pop
I am so fab
Check out, I'm blonde
I'm skinny
I'm rich
And I'm a little bit of a bitch
I wanna dress you up in silk, taffeta
Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt, what's your size?
This purse can hold my black card and tiara
Versace promises I will dolce vita
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?
[Chorus]
Donatella!
(I'm smoking 'em on full tank of gas)
Mi-mi-bella!
(I'm a rich bitch, I'm the upper class)
All of the day
(I'm the pearl to your oyster, I'm a babe)
I'm gonna smoke Marlboro Lights and drink champagne!
(I smoke Marlboro Reds and drink champagne!)
Donatella!
Cuz she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she's misunderstood
Voodoo voodoo, voo-don-na-na
Walk down the runway but don't puke, it's okay
You just had a salad today, boulangerie
Just ask your gay friends their advice, before you
Get a spray tan on holiday, in Taipei
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?
[Chorus]
Donatella!
(I'm smoking 'em on full tank of gas)
Mi-mi-bella!
(I'm a rich bitch, I'm the upper class)
All of the day
(I'm the pearl to your oyster, I'm a babe)
I'm gonna smoke Marlboro Lights and drink champagne!
(I smoke Marlboro Reds and drink champagne!)
Donatella!
Cuz she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she's misunderstood
Voodoo voodoo, voo-doo-na-na
Check it out
Take it in
Who's that bitch?
She's so thin
She's so rich
And so blonde
She's so fab
It's beyond
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?
Donatella!
Oh-oh oh-oh
Donatella!
Oh-oh oh-oh
All of the day
Oh-oh oh-oh
All of the day
I'm gonna wear designer and drink champagne
Donatella!
Donatella!
Cuz she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she's misunderstood
Voodoo voodoo, voo-don-na-na
Voo-don-na-na
