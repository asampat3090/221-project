If I know one thing, that's true
It ain't what you say, it's what you do
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
But I listen when you do
A thousand years go by
But love don't die
If I know one thing, that's true
Instead I'm never leaving you
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
But I lose it when you do
Don't let them tell no lie
Love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
If there is one thing, that's true
It's not what I say, it's what I do
And I say too much, yeah, that's true
So just listen to what I do
A thousand years go by
But love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
She can break it up
Shake your money down
You can box it in
Bury it in the ground
You can close it off and turn it away
Try to keep it down, six feet in the ground
But love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
Unlock so out some shine
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
