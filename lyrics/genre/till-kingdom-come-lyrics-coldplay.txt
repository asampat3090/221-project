Coldplay
rock
One, two
Steal my heart and hold my tongue
I feel my time, my time has come
Let me in, unlock the door
I never felt this way before
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come
Hold my head inside your hands
I need someone who understands
I need someone, someone who hears
For you I've waited all these years
For you, I'd wait 'till kingdom come
Until my day, my day is done
And say, you'll come and set me free
Just say, you'll wait, you'll wait for me
In your tears and in your blood
In your fire and in your flood
I hear you laugh, I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I've become
For you I'd wait 'till kingdom come
Until my days, my days are done
Say, you'll come and set me free
Just say, you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Just say, you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Just say, you'll wait, you'll wait for me
