hiphop
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gonna party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck, it's not your birthday
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got what you need, you need to feel the buzz
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggaz heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes, they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nuttin' changed hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood, in L.A. they sayin,"50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York them niggaz'll tell ya, I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm fully focused man, my money on my mind
Got a mill' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow
Her girlfriend willin' to get bi and they ready to go
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look nigga, I done came up, and I ain't changed
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she's gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggaz hate then let 'em hate then watch the money pile up
Or we can go upside your head wit a bottle of bub
They know where we fuckin' be
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin' rubbed
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither nigga
We in the club all the time nigga, it's about to pop off nigga
