So easy to forget our love,
The little things we do,
Like calling for no reason
Just to say the words
"Baby I love you,"
I know lately, I've been busy
But a second doesn't go by
Without you crossing my mind
It's been so long since we had time
Let's take a day & make everything right
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Lets runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated,
It only takes a day to change it.
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day
So let's runaway...
Let's runaway, just for the day
Runaway, runaway
Girl, you've been so patient
Spending nights alone & not complaining
But I'll make it up to you,
And I promise today I won't keep you waiting
Please give me this one chance
To remind you of everything we have
I won't give up I'm too much in love
And I want you to know that
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day,
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day
So let's runaway for the day
And I'll give everything in this moment
And I promise to make everyday just like the day
Let's runaway to the place
Here love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day.
So let's runaway........
