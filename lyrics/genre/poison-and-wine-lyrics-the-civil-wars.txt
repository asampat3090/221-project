You only know what I want you to
I know everything you don't want me to
Your mouth is poison, your mouth is wine
You think your dreams are the same as mine
Ooh, I don't love you but I always will
Ooh, I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
I always will
I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back
The less I give, the more I get back
Ooh, your hands can heal, your hands can bruise
I don't have a choice but I still choose you
Ooh, I don't love you but I always will
Ooh, I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
Ooh, I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
I don't love you but I always will
I always will, I always will, I always will
I always will, I always will
