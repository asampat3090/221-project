It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm just scared to stay
I said I'd leave, I can never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel, if I should choose to go?
Another guy, you think it'd be unlikely
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you gotta turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now
Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now
