There's a place out there for us
More than just a prayer or anything you've ever dreamed of
So when you feel like giving up, 'cause you don't fit in down here
Fear is crashing in, close your eyes and take my hand, yeah
We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong where, faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us
There's a place for us
When the water meets the sky
Where your heart is free and hope comes back to life
When these broken hands are whole again
We'll find what we've been waiting for, we were made for so much more
We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong, where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us
There's a place for us
So hold on, hold on
There's a place for us
We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong, where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us
