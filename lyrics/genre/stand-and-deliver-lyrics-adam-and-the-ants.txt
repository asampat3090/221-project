Stand and deliver
I'm the dandy highwayman who you're too scared to mention
I spend my cash on looking flash and grabbing your attention
The devil take your stereo and your record collection
The way you look you'll qualify for next year's old age pension
Stand and deliver your money or your life!
Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife!
I'm the dandy highwayman so sick of easy fashion
The clumsy boots, peek-a-boo roots that people think so dashing
So what's the point of robbery when nothing is worth taking?
It's kind of tough to tell a scruff the big mistake he's making
Stand and deliver your money or your life!
Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife!
And even though you fool your souls
Your conscience will be mine all mine
We're the dandy highwaymen so tired of excuses
Of deep meaning philosophies where only showbiz loses
We're the dandy highwaymen, here's our invitation
"Throw your safety overboard and join our insect nation"
Stand and deliver your money or your life!
Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife!
And even though you fool your souls
Your conscience will be mine, all mine
Da diddley qa qa, da diddley qa qa
Da diddley qa qa, da diddley qa qa
Da diddley qa qa, da diddley qa qa
Da diddley qa qa, da diddley qa qa
Stand and deliver your money or your life!
Stand and deliver your money or your life!
Stand and deliver your money or your life!
