I've been left out alone like a damn criminal
I've been praying for help 'cause I can't take it all
I'm not done, it's not over
Now I'm fighting this war since the day of the fall
And I'm desperately holding on to it all
But I'm lost, I'm so damn lost
Oh, I wish it was over and I wish you were here
Still I'm hoping that somehow
'Cause your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?
I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands
What can I do? Don't let it fall apart, a shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
In the blink of an eye I can see through your eyes
As I'm lying awake I'm still hearing the cries
And it hurts, hurts me so bad
And I'm wondering why I still fight in this life
'Cause I've lost all my faith in this damn bitter strife
And it's sad, it's so damn sad
Oh, I wish it was over and I wish you were here
Still I'm hoping that somehow
'Cause your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?
I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands
What can I do? Don't let it fall apart, a shot in the dark
A shot in the dark, a shot in the dark
A shot in the dark, a shot in the dark
I feel you fading away, I feel you fading away
I feel you fading away, I feel you fading away
'Cause your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?
I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands
What can I do? Don't let it fall apart
Oh, your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?
I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands
What can I do? Don't let it fall apart, a shot in the dark
A shot in the dark, a shot in the dark
A shot in the dark, a shot in the dark
