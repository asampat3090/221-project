In a manner of speaking I just want to say
That I could never forget the way
You told me everything
By saying nothing
In a manner of speaking I don't understand
How love in silence becomes reprimand
But the way that I feel about you
Is beyond words
Oh give me the words, give me the words
But tell me nothing
Ooh give me the words, give me the words
That tell me everything
In a manner of speaking, semantics won't do
In this life that we live we only make do
And the way that we feel
Might have to be sacrificed
So in a manner of speaking, I just want to say
That just like you, I should find a way
To tell you everything
By saying nothing
Oh give me the words, give me the words
But tell me nothing
Ooh give me the words, give me the words
That tell me everything
Oh give me the words, give me the words
But tell me nothing
Ooh give me the words, give me the words
That tell me everything
