Where do we go, nobody knows
I've gotta say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face
Where do we go to draw the line
I've gotta say, I wasted all your time, oh honey, honey
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon your face, yeah
Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I want it too
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine
Where do we go, nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down, when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face, oh yeah
Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I want it too
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
Where do we go, nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down, when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
