My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, you have found peace
You were searching for release
You gave it all into the call
You took a chance and
You took the fall for us
You came thoughtfully
Loved me faithfully
You taught me honor
You did it for me
Tonight you will sleep for good
You will wait for me, my love
Now I am strong, you gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am home
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, look what you can do
I am mending, I'll be with you
You took my hand and added a plan
You gave me your heart
I asked you to dance with me
You loved honestly
Did what you could release
Ah, ooh
I know in peace you go
I hope relief is yours
Now I am strong, you gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am home
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, I'll be with you
