L.A. proved too much for the man
(Too much for the man he couldn't make it)
So he's leavin' the life
He's come to know, ooh
(He said he's goin')
He said he's goin' back to find
(Goin' back to find)
Ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind not so long ago
Oh, he's leavin'
(Leavin')
On that midnight train to Georgia, yeah
(Leavin' on that midnight train)
Said, he's goin' back
(Goin' back to find)
To a simpler place in time
(When he takes that ride)
Oh yes, he is
(Guess who's gonna be right by his side)
And I'll be with him
(I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leavin' on that midnight train to Georgia, ooh ooh)
I'd rather live in his world
(Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(My world is his, his and hers alone)
He kept dreamin'
(Dreamin')
Ooh, that someday, he'd be a star
(A superstar but he didn't get far)
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true, oh no
(Dreams don't always come true, aha, no, aha)
So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket back
To the life he once knew
Oh, yes, he did, he said he would
Oh, he's leavin'
(Leavin')

And I'm gonna be with him
(I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia

(Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(My world is his, his and hers alone)
