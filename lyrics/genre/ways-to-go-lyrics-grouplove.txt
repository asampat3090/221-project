I didn't ask for this
You give me heart attack
I didn't want to care
And then I saw you there
Been working like a dog
I turned all my dreams off
I didn't know my name, I didn't know my name
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)
Even when I can't see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day (Even when I sleep all day)
Even if I work it like I'm times two
Living in the back of the bunk just like we do
Even when I dream all day
Don't wanna sleep tonight
You've got me feeling right
I didn't know my name, I didn't know my name
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)
Even when I can't see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day (Even when I sleep all day)
Even if I work it like I'm times two
Living in the back of the bunk just like we do
Even when I dream all day
Even when I dream all day
Oh I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Even if I smoke in the back room
Even if I go right to meet you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I work it like I'm times two
Waiting for the day just to end so I see you
Even when I dream all day, even when I dream all day
