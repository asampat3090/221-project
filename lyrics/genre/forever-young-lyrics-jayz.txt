Jay-Z
hiphop
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
So we live a life like a video when the sun is always out
And you never get old and the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good and the pretty girls
Just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day to last a whole lifetime
And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine, I'm forever young
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living up tight, see ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here, shorty
The nigga from here with a little ambition
Just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me, baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping out of Porsches
Popping up on Forbes lists, gorgeous, hold up
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous
Hold up, I'll be here forever you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit less than four bars
Guru bring the chorus in, did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of young
Forever young I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
