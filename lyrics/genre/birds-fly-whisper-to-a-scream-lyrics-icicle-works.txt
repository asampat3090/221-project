Love come down upon us till you flow like water
Burning with the hope of insight
Feathered, look they're covered with a bright elation
Stolen in the sight of love
We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream
Birds fly in the eyes of the faithless daughter
Broken at the bitter end
Wasted sacrificed for a new nirvana
Nighttime sends us on our way
We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever a whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
A whisper to a scream
We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever a whisper to a scream
We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever a whisper to a scream
We are, we are, we are but your children
Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever a whisper to a scream
