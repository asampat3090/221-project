Without givin you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things
Like all of them diamond rings bitches kill for
Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't drivin?
If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it - could ya
See yourself with a nigga workin harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla? so you can shop and tear the mall up?
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up

Feel the juice, then I got ya, when you produce a rocka
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa

Since I met a chick ain't on my tips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell em be gone
