You broke my heart
'Cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
And now I'm back
To let you know
I can really shake 'em down
Do you love me?
(I can really move)
Do you love me?
(I'm in the groove)
Ah, do you love?
(Do you love me)
Now that I can dance
(Dance)
Watch me now, oh
(Work, work)
Ah, work it all baby
(Work, work)
Well, you're drivin' me crazy
(Work, work)
With a little bit of soul now
(Work)
I can mash-potatoe
(I can mash-potatoe)
And I can do the twist
(I can do the twist)
Now tell me baby
(Tell me baby)
Mmm, do you like it like this
(Do you like it like this)
Tell me
(Tell me)
Tell me
Do you love me?
(Do you love me)
Now, do you love me?
(Do you love me)
Now, do you love me?
(Do you love me)
Now that I can dance
(Dance)
Dance
Watch me now, oh
(Work, work)
Ah, shake it up, shake it
(Work, work)
Ah, shake 'em, shake 'em down
(Work, work)
Ah, little bit of soul now
(Work)
(Work, work)
Ah, shake it, shake it baby
(Work, work)
Ah, you're driving me crazy
(Work, work)
Ah, don't get lazy
(Work)
I can mash-potatoe
(I can mash-potatoe)
And I can do the twist

Well now tell me baby
