rock
Know I've done wrong, left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so long, where only fools gone
I shook the angel in you!
Now I'm rising from the crowd
Rising up to you!
Feel with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do!
Chorus:
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
It's unforgivable,
I stole and burnt your soul
Is that what demons do, hey?
They rule the worst in me
Destroy everything,
They blame on angels like you, hey!
Now I'm rising from the crowd
Rising up to you!
Feel with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do!
Chorus:
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
Uh, uh, uh, uh!
Oh, oh!
Told you once again,
Do this again, do this again, oh!
I told you once again,
Do this again, do this again, oh, oh!
Chorus:
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
