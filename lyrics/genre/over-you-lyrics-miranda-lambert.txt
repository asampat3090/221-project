Verse 1:
Weather man said it's gonna snow
By now I should be used to the cold
Mid-February shouldn't be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me
Chorus:
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be ok
But I'm not going to ever get over you
Verse 2:
Living alone here in this place
I think of you, and I'm not afraid
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn't mean to give them to me
Chorus:
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be ok
But I'm not going to ever get over you
It really sinks in you know when I see it in stone
Cause you went away, how dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be ok
But I'm not going to ever get over you
