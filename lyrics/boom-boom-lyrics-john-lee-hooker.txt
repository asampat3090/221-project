blues
Boom, boom, boom, boom
I'm gonna shoot you right down
Right off your feet
Take you home with me
Put you in my house
Boom, boom, boom, boom
I love to see you strut
Up and down the floor
And when you talking to me that baby talk
I like it like that
Oh, when you talk like that
You knocks me out
Right off of my feet
Hoo, hoo, hoo, whoa, yeah
Walk the walk baby
Talk that talk right now
And talk that talk right now, baby
Whoa, yeah
And talk that talk
And walk that walk
Walk the walk, baby
And talk that talk
And you whisper in my ear
I can't take it like that
You knocks me out
And when you talk like that
I can't take it like that
Oh, when you talk like that
You knocks me out
Right off of my feet
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hoo, hoo, hoo
Walk the walk baby
Talk that talk right now baby
You can talk that talk, baby
Talk that talk, that baby talk
Can't take it like that
No baby
