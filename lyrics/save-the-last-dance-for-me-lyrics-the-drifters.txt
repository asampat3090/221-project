blues
You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, mmm
Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparkling wine go and have your fun
Laugh and sing but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, mmm
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh, so much
You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone and it's time to go
If he asks, if you're all alone
Can he take you home, you must tell him, no
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arm's you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arm's you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, mmm
Save the last dance for me, mmm, mmm
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Save the last dance for me
