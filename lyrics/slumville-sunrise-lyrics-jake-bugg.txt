The wind keeps beating on my window
I haven't slept all night
That drum just keeps on banging
They must be buzzing in their minds
Like bees in the hive, tell me when the morning arrives
This place is just not for me, I say it all the time
My friends they just ignore me
Tell me nevermind, waiting all your life, for the Slumville Sunrise
Slumville Sunrise
Nobody cares or looks twice
Shout away in the morning across this place where I was born in
Every roof, every flower illuminated by the dawning
My face upon the concrete, the dirt is in my mouth
I clench my fist and feet
I try to cry out loud
Make a sound, somethin is keepin me down
This place is just not for me
I'll say it a thousand times
My friends they just ignore me
Tell me never mind, waiting all your life, for the Slumville Sunrise
Slumville Sunrise
Nobody cares or looks twice
Shout away in the morning across this place where I was born in
Every roof, every flower illuminated by the dawning

This place is just not for me

Tell me never mind, waiting all your life, for the Slumville Sunrise
Slumville Sunrise
Nobody cares or looks twice
Shout away in the morning, across this place where I was born in
Every roof, every flower illuminated by the dawning
Every roof, every flower illuminated by the dawning
