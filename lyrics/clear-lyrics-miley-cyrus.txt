It's six a.m. and I'm wide awake
'Cause I can't stop thinking
About the stuff you'll say
And me and I, I can't let it slide
The paper's not here yet the sun's not up
But I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel inside
I had one of those dreams that make it all so
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me
How long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear
Why did I smile when I hurt inside?
Said I was okay when I knew it's a lie
I wanted to believe in you
You took your chances and one was me
So I'll just forgive you and set you free
I'm on my way
Yeah I'm stepping out of the haze
And it's so clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me
How long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear
I wanna put the past behind
Try and maybe I can find better days
The first time in a while
Think I even feel a smile on my face
I got a whole new perspective
You can't treat me that way
It's so clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me
How long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear
Yeah, so clear
So clear, so clear
Ooh
Sun's going down on a Saturday
And I feel all right, I feel okay
