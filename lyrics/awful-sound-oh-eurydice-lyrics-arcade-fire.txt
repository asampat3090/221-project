You and I were born
In a little town
Before the awful sound
Started coming down
Oh no
Oh
You came home from school
And knew you had to run
Please stop running now
Just let me be the one
For you
I know you can see
Things that we can't see
But when I say I love you
Your silence covers me
Oh, Eurydice, It's an awful sound
I was so disappointed
You didn't want me
Oh, how could it be, Eurydice
I was standing beside you
By a frozen sea
Will you ever get free?
Just take all your pain
Just put it on me
So that you can breathe
When you fly away
Will you hit the ground?
It's an awful sound
[Chorus]
I know there's a way
We can make 'em pay
Think it over and say
"I'm never going back again."
I know there's a way
We can leave today
Think it over and say
"I'm never going back again."
You were born in the little town
Before the awful sound
Started coming down
There's so much inside you
That you won't let me see
You fly away from me
But it's an awful sound
When you hit the ground
It's an awful sound
When you hit the ground
[Chorus]
I know there's a way
We can make 'em pay
Think it over and say
"I'm never going back again."
I know there's a way
We can leave today
Think it over...
We know there's a price to pay
For love in the reflective age
I met you up upon a stage
Our love in a reflective age
Oh no, now you're gone
