Even my best days without you
Were nothing in comparison to my worst days
Once I have found you
Once I had you
I had everything
I had everything
I had everything
Please dont leave
Its all happening
When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
I asked you beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smilling in your sleep
You would talk to me, in my wildest dreams
I never knew I found somebody like you
Like you
Like you
I found somebody like you
Like you
Like you
When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
I asked you beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smilling in your sleep
You would talk to me, in my wildest dreams
I never knew I found somebody like you
Like you
Like you
I found somebody like you
Like you
Like you
Like you
