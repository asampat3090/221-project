I hear you calling Inndia
Welcome to Inndia
We don't need nobody but Inndia
She's enough to make your body go wild
Are you ready right here right now
It's a little bit scandalous
But she lives her life a little bit dangerous
Everybody in the club, can you handle us?
Are you ready right here right now
Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move?
Are you feeling naughty?
I'm gonna hypnotize you
Are you ready for me?
And then you'll never say no, no, no
The sky is the limit
I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize
And your mind off the time
Oh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no
Uh, la la la la la la la la la
Uh, la la la la la la la la la
Uh, la la la la la la la la la
I hear you calling Inndia
Uh, la la la la la la la la la

Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move?
Are you feeling naughty?
I'm gonna hypnotize you
Are you ready for me?
And then you'll never say no, no, no
The sky is the limit
I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize
And your mind off the time
Oh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no
Uh, la la la la la la la la la

And if you're ballin'
Let me hear you callin'
Cause we'll be at the after party till the mornin'
