Sparkling angel I believed
You are my savior in my time of need
Blinded by faith, I couldn't hear
All the whispers, the warnings so clear
I see the angels, I'll lead them to your door
There's no escape now, no mercy no more
No remorse 'cause I still remember
The smile when you tore me apart
You took my heart, deceived me right from the start
You showed me dreams, I wished they turn into real
You broke the promise and made me realize
It was all just a lie
Sparkling angel, I couldn't see
Your dark intentions, your feelings for me
Fallen angel, tell me why
What is the reason, the thorn in your eye?
I see the angels, I'll lead them to your door
There's no escape now, no mercy no more
No remorse 'cause I still remember
The smile when you tore me apart
You took my heart, deceived me right from the start
You showed me dreams, I wished they turn into real
You broke the promise and made me realize
It was all just a lie
Could have been forever
Now we have reached the end
This world may have failed you
It doesn't give you a reason why
You could have chosen a different path in life
The smile when you tore me apart
You took my heart, deceived me right from the start
You showed me dreams, I wished they turn into real
You broke the promise and made me realize
It was all just a lie
Could have been forever
Now we have reached the end
