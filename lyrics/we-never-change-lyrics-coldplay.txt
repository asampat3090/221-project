I want to live life
Never be cruel
I want to live life
Be good to you
I want to fly
And never come down
And live my life
And have friends around
We never change do we
We never learn do we
So I want to live in a wooden house
I want to live life always be true
I want to live life and be good to you
I want to fly and never come down
And live my life
And have friends around
We never change do we
No no
We never learn do we
So I want to live in a wooden house
Making more friends would be easy
Oh and I don't have a soul to save
Yes and I sin every single day
We never change do we
We never learn do we
So I want to live in a wooden house
Making more friends would be easy
I want to live where the sun comes out
