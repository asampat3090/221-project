[Looks innocent enough, doesn't it? But sometimes there are dangers involved that never meet the eye. No matter where you meet a stranger, be careful if they are too friendly...]
Hey, a casual affair
That could go anywhere
And only for tonight
Take any moment, any time
A lover on the left
A sinner on the right
Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(hush-hush, don't you say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
Break involuntary ties
A secret so the spies
Could never find us out
Stay for as long as you have time
So the mess that we'll become
Leaves something to talk about
Just lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(hush-hush, don't you say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(I did it, I did it, I did it... I did it again)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
(hush-hush, don't you say a word)
Lay in the atmosphere
A casual affair
