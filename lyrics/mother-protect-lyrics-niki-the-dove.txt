I used to friend with trees, I have a call
I close my eyes and wait for the echo
And you came in a hurricane,
I watched you in the dark
Never seen nothing like it,
No one has matched the spark
I used to follow you, follow you for days
I slept beside you, just shadows away
I watched you by the fire, your hands was all aglow
Under the spell of a circle, I let my face show
Oh my heart is like an eagle, I love to fall from the sky
It's so beautiful, I see right through the water's edge
And I love your hands, I let them lead me into the cage
So tender but your body was warm, so frail,
But your eyes like mine,
The color of ice
You can't keep me down, I am done, I am furious
Fear the lioness paint her face black and golden
You can't keep me down, I am done, I am furious
(you're my weakest part)
Fear the lioness paint her face black and golden
(you're my weakest part)
You can't keep me down, I am done, I am furious
(so strong)
Fear the lioness paint her face black and golden
You can't keep me down, I am done, I am furious
(I'm so strong, so strong)
Fear the lioness paint her face black and golden
