So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I seen this one, I'm bout to go in
Then she said, I'm here with my friends
She got me thinking, and that's when I said
Where dem girls at, girls at?
Where dem girls at, girls at?
Where dem girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends
[Flo Rida - Verse 1]
Hey, bring it on baby, all your friends
You're the shit and I love that body
You wanna ball, lets mix it, I swear you're good, I wont tell nobody
You got a BFF, I wanna see that girl, it's all women invited
Hair do's and nails, that Louwwie, Chanel all up in the body
President's in my wallet, no rules I'm bout it
Blow the whistle for the hotties
I got it, shawty, it's never too much, can't be doing too much
10 to one of me, I can handle that love
Outta of my reach, we can all get buzz
holla cause I'm free, no matter it's no rush
[Hook]
So many boys in here where do I begin

Where dem girls at, girls at?
Where dem girls at, girls at?
Where dem girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends
[Nicki Minaj - Verse 2]
