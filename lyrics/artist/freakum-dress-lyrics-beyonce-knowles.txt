To be or not to be, not!
Hold up, bring the beat back
Stop! I aint ready yet
Wait! Let me fix my hair, yes, yes
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am
Now pass me my dress, yes
I think Im ready
Been locked up in the house way too long
Its time to get it
'Cause once again hes out doing wrong
And my girls are so real
Said its been a minute since I had some
Hes been acting up
But he wont be the only one
'Cause when he acts up, thats when you put it on
Get him uptight, this is your song
Hold out your back, time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress !
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, pull out the big guns
Oh, and put your freakum dress on
Soon as he saw me
Turned on by how the dress was fittin' right
Short and backless
See my silhouette in the moonlight
Such an attraction
Keep tellin' me how my outfits so nice
Little did he know
Ha, my man gon' take it off tonight
'Cause when he acts up, thats when you put it on
Get him uptight, this is your song
Hold out your back, time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, pull out the big gun
Oh, and put your freakum dress on
All the ladies, you ain't these
All dressed up in your dresses
And your bestest with no reason
Get ready to freakum, freakum
When you put it on its an invitation
When they play your the song, get on up and shake it
Work it out your back, you dont have to waste it
Spin it all around then take it to the ground and
When you put it on its an invitation
When they play your the song, get on up and shake it
Work it out your back, you dont have to waste it
Spin it all around then take it to the ground and
'Cause when he acts up, thats when you put it on
Get him uptight, this is your song
Hold out your back, time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, pull out the big guns
Oh, and put your freakum dress on
Ladies look it here
When you been with your man for a long time, oh
Every now and then you gotta go in the back of that closet
And pull out that freakum dress, oh
I got my freakum dress on
I got my freakum dress on, oh
I got my freakum dress on
I got my freakum dress on, oh
