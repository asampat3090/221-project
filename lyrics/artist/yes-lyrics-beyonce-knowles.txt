I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
(It's like I never say yes)
I said, yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say, no, not tonight
You acting so ungratefully
The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
(It's like I never say yes)
You was on the wall, I was with my crew
You was watching me, baby, I was watching you
Slowly you walked over, I maintained my cool
You said hello to me, I said hello to you
You asked me where I'm from, I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me, I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
(It's like I never say yes)
I said, yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say, no, not tonight
You acting so ungratefully
The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
(It's like I never say yes)
Certainly you can call me, baby, I love to hear from you
Yes, of course, you can come and see me, boy
Wanna get to know you more, sure I'm feeling you
No, baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset, boy
You act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful
You was at my house, I was sitting on my couch
You was really bugging so I told you to get out
I have been misjudging you, you had a lot of nerve
You too damn old to be so immature, I hope you learned
You said I move too slow, I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later, I said don't call no more
But it's cool if you can't wait for me, I'm glad you let me know
'Cuz you showed me your true face, baby, the first time I said no
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
(It's like I never say yes)
I said, yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say, no, not tonight
You acting so ungratefully
The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
(It's like I never say yes)
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I said no
It's like I never said yes
(It's like I never say yes)
