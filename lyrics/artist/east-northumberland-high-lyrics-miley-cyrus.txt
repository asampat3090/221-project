My problem isn't that I miss you
'Cuz I don't
My problem isn't that I kissed you
Whoa oh
I figured out
That you're nothin' that I thought you're about
You're just caught in a place
It's what time will erase in my heart
You're my type of guy I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you
Your problem's not for lack of tryin'
'Cuz you do
It's just that you're at your best when you're lyin'
Whoa oh
Now you're standing here
And saying things you think I wanted to hear
But you got it all wrong
I've already moved on, my dear
You're my type of guy I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you
When you're standing near me
I don't see so clearly
The feelings are still palpable
But when I take two steps away
It sheds some light on my day
Yeah you can't go back
It's all in the past
Guess you gotta laugh at it
You're my type of guy I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
And if there's some confusion
Let me tell ya, you're just delusional
Get a clue, 'cuz people change
Thank God I did
Thank God I did
Thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you
It doesn't mean I like you
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Rock and roll, rock it
