Fiendish wonder in a carnival's wake
Old caresses once again irritate
Tread softly stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek
You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trends quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless
And weightless your imagination runs
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That precession of pioneers all drown
And the moonlight they're more thrilling
Those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning, bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit is like falling off the ferry in the night
The inevitables gather to push you around
Any old voice makes such a punishing sound
He became laughter's assassin
Shortly after he showed you what it was
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hands
That precession of pioneers all drown
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until you return
If you've a lesson to teach me
Don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until you return
If you've a lesson to teach me
Don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until you return
If you've a lesson to teach me
Don't deviate, don't be afraid
