Duets
pop
Shadows are fallin' all over town
Another night and these blues got me down
Oh misery, I sure could use some company
Since he's been gone, I ain't been the same
I carry the weight like an old ball and chain
Guess, it's all meant to be for love to cause me misery
Oh misery, oh misery
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause me misery
And oh, I've been down this road before
With a passion it turns into pain
And each time I saw love walk out the door
I swore I never get caught again
But ain't it true, it takes what it takes
And sometime we get too smart to leave
One more heartache for me
Another night of misery, oh
Oh, oh misery, oh misery
Tell me why does my heart make a fool of me
Oh misery, oh misery
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why does this
Heart make a fool of me?
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause misery, oh
Misery, guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause me misery, oh no, yeah
Misery
