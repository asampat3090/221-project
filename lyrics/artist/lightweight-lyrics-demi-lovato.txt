The slightest words you said
Have all gone to my head
I hear angels sing
In your voice
When you pull me close
Feelings I've never known
They mean everything
And leave me no choice
Light on my heart
Light on my feet
Light in your eyes
I can't even speak
Do you even know
How you make me weak
I'm a lightweight
Better be careful what you say
With every word
I'm blown away
You're in control of my heart
I'm a lightweight
Easy to fall, easy to break
With every move my whole world shakes
Keep me from falling apart
Make a promise, please
You'll always be in reach
Just in case I need
You there when I call
This is all so new
Seems too good to be true
Could this really be
A safe place to fall
Light on my heart
Light on my feet
Light in your eyes
I can't even speak
Do you even know
How you make me weak
I'm a lightweight
Better be careful what you say
With every word
I'm blown away
You're in control of my heart
I'm a lightweight
Easy to fall, easy to break
With every move my whole world shakes
Keep me from falling apart
Keep me from falling down
Drowned in your love
It's almost all too much
Handle with care
Say you'll be there
Oh, I'm a lightweight
Better be careful what you say
With every word
I'm blown away
You're in control of my heart
I'm a lightweight
Easy to fall, easy to break
With every move my whole world shakes
Keep me from falling apart
Keep me from falling apart
Keep me from falling apart
Falling apart
