Baby, I don't wanna spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around sometime
I wouldn't pass right by you
Maybe it's because you are so insecure
And maybe your pain don't care
Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
It falls away and it's just not there
You burn another bridge
Break another heart
You try again, it will only fall apart
Infatuation, not seeing the rest of you
Is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
Would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy then why is it killing me?
And I guess this must be infatuation
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it
I try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be
And now her face is something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more
Burn another bridge
Break another heart
You try again, it will only fall apart
Infatuation, not seeing the rest of you
Is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
Would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy then why is it killing me?
And I guess this must be infatuation
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it
I'm so attracted to you
The feeling's mutual too
And I get scared the moment you leave
Get so hot, I forget to breathe, yeah
Infatuation, not seeing the rest of you
Is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
Would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy then why is it killing me?
And I guess this must be infatuation
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it
