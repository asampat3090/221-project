rock
One two
On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah
On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah
On the mats with the boys, you think you're alone
With the pain that you drain from love
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world
'Cause Andy, you're a star
Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah
On the streets, such a sweet face jump in town
In the staff room the verdict is in
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world
'Cause Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes
In nobody's eyes but mine
