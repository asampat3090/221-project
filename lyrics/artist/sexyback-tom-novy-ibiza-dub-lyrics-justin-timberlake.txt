I'm bringing sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think you're special, what's behind your back?
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
Take 'em to the bridge
Dirty babe
You see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Take 'em to the chorus
Come here girl
Go ahead, be gone with it
Come to the back
Go ahead, be gone with it
V.I.P.
Go ahead, be gone with it
Drinks on me
Go ahead, be gone with it
Let me see what you're working with
Go ahead, be gone with it
Look at those hips
Go ahead, be gone with it
You make me smile
Go ahead, be gone with it
Go ahead child
Go ahead, be gone with it
And get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
I'm bringing sexy back
Them other fuckers don't know how to act
Come let me make up for the things you lack
'Cause your burning up I gotta get it fast
Take 'em to the bridge
Dirty baby
You see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Take 'em to the chorus
Come here girl
Go ahead, be gone with it
Come to the back
Go ahead, be gone with it
V.I.P.
Go ahead, be gone with it
Drinks on me
Go ahead, be gone with it
Let me see what you're working with
Go ahead, be gone with it
Look at those hips
Go ahead, be gone with it
You make me smile
Go ahead, be gone with it
Go ahead child
Go ahead, be gone with it
And get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
I'm bringing sexy back
You muh'fuckers watch how I attack
If that's your girl you better watch your back
'Cause she'll burn it up on me and that's a fact
Take 'em to the chorus
Come here girl
Go ahead, be gone with it
Come to the back
Go ahead, be gone with it
V.I.P.
Go ahead, be gone with it
Drinks on me
Go ahead, be gone with it
Let me see what you're working with
Go ahead, be gone with it
Look at those hips
Go ahead, be gone with it
You make me smile
Go ahead, be gone with it
Go ahead child
Go ahead, be gone with it
And get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on

Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get your sexy on
