Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too
You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette
Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned
But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye
Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am
