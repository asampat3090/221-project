If I beg and if I cry would it change the sky tonight?
Will it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call? Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by?
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
And then I lie all by myself, I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed, if it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
I missed all the signs one at a time
You were ready
What did I know starting our lives
No, my love I'm ready to show
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, you disappear, disappear
