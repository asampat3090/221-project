pop
[Verse 1]
All the way in the back, with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, what you doing with that
If you say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me, one day he wants me not
I don't do chances, cause time isn't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sitting round here waiting for a man
to tell me where the fuck my CV at
Where Mike Will at
[Chorus]
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff, bangerz bangerz
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff
I can strut in my stuff, bangerz
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff
I can strut that strut, that strut, that stuff
Fucking bangerz
I can strut in my stuff bangerz bangerz
[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
I'm flying high upon the bird, acrophobia
My slick carder, I ain't down my purse where the dollars at
I let them know the rings two on the first
They can call the hearse cause if there's
anybody violation I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with the big dog
All I need is milli's when I got Billy on my speed dial
You know I'm that meow, quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the corner, make them nervous, call it too much
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Play boss the play
Doctor get that big ross
Sit that on my hand
Make that video big talk
Play boss the play
Strike that boss with the purple
Got up in my brain
Had me a little bit dismal
[Outro]
I,I bangerz, I,I fucking bangerz I,I bangerz fucking bangerz
