That's M O N E Y, so sexy, I
Damn, I love the Jag, the jet and the mansion
Oh yeah
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands
Oh yeah
It's good to live expensive you know it
But my knees get weak, intensive
When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey
That's M O N E Y, so sexy, I
That's money, honey
Damn, I'd love a boat by the beach on the west coast
Oh yeah
And I'd enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast
Oh yeah
It's good to live expensive you know it
But my knees get weak, intensive
When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey
You know I appreciate the finer things
But it's not what makes me happiest, baby
(I can do without it, babe)
Your tender loving's more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle, baby, baby
K-k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey
When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey
When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey
That's M O N E Y, so sexy, I
