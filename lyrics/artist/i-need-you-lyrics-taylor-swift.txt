{Taylor}
I'm all alone and it's too dark
I need a man on my mark
In times like these I still need a guy
Nick you are so mine
Hey, Nick I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
I don't how I can be without you
I need you
{Demi}
I'm still alone inside this cage
Still need a man but it's not the same
In times like these I still need a guy
Joe you are still mine
Hey, Joe I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
I don't how I can be without you
I need you
{Taylor & Demi}
In times like these we still need some guys
Yeah, you are still mine
Hey, guys I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
I don't how I can be without you
I need you
