I wanna be drunk when I wake up,
On the right side of the wrong bed,
And never an excuse I made up,
Tell you the truth I hate,
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all,
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me,
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober,
I know i'll never hold you like I used to
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating,
Without you to hold i'll be freezing,
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take parts of it every evening,
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing,
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I,
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again, I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love.
I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a coke can,
And i've got no plans for the weekend,
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There maybe other people like us,
Who see the flicker of the clipper when they light up,
Flames just create us, burns dont heal like before
You dont hold me anymore
On cold days cold play's out like the band's name
I know i cant heal things with a handshake
You know i can change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love
