You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see I'm searching for what used to be, mine
I saw your eyes
And I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you
She was mine
I was hers
And all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scarred and left me
Like a sunburn
Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
