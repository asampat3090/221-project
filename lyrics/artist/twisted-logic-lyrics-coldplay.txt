Sunlight opened up my eyes
To see for the first time
It opened them up
And tonight rivers will run dry
Not for the first time
Rivers will run
Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers
Lookin' for life on earth
Don't fight for the wrong side
Say, what you feel like
Say, how you feel
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go
Created then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it
Someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to
It belongs to all of us
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards
