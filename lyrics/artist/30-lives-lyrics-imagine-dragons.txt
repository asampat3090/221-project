Good morning my love
It's been a while since we have talked
You have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Thirty lives can be extraordinarily long
Lay me down
Lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Alright
Good morning myself
It's been a while since we have talked
You have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over
But lay me down
Lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Alright
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Alright
