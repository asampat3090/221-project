Harry: (waiting for a girl like you)
Liam:
The light shines,
It's getting hot on my shoulders.
I don't mind,
This time it doesn't matter
Cause your friends,
They look good, but you look better
Don't you know all night I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around, round, round?
Harry and Niall:
Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight (eh eh eh eh)
With just one look, yeah Zayn:(eh eh eh eh)
Been waiting for a girl like you
Liam:
I'm weaker
My words fall and they hit the ground
Oh life, come on head, don't you fail me now?
I start to say,
"I think I love you," but I make no sound
You know 'cause all my life, I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around
Harry and Niall:
Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight (eh eh eh eh)
With just one look, yeah Zayn:(eh eh eh eh)
Been waiting for a girl like you
Zayn:
There is no other place that I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
Cause there's so much that I wanna say, I wanna say
Harry and Niall:
Under the lights tonight
You turned around, and you stole my heart
With just one look, when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart
Under the lights tonight (eh eh eh eh)
You turned around, and you stole my heart (eh eh eh eh)
With just one look, when I saw your face (eh eh eh eh)
I fell in love
It took a minute girl (eh eh eh eh) to steal my heart tonight (eh eh eh eh)
With just one look, yeah (eh eh eh eh)
Been waitin' for a girl like you
