I looked away
Then I looked back at you
You tried to say
The things that you can't undo
If I had my way
I'd never get over you
But today's the day
I pray that we make it through
Make it through the fall
Make it through it all
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you
I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I'm in love with you
You're the only one
I'd be with 'til the end
When I come undone
You bring me back again
Back under the stars
Back into your arms
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you
I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I'm in love with you
Wanna know who you are?
Wanna know where to start?
I wanna know what this means
Wanna know how you feel?
Wanna know what is real?
I wanna know everything, everything
I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you
And I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
