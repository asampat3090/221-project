I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him or anything like me
So you might as well sit back 'cause I ain't tryin to show maturity
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker
So I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleanin up that mess
He found 30 of the pieces but he'll never find 'em all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker
Well I don't appreciate you callin him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seein just how much better off he is
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Ohhhhhh
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To Write on his heart
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To Write on his heart
In permanent marker
In permanent marker
Oh
Permanent marker
