Unhappy days that left us on the floor
And you'd breathe me 'til you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton I'll take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened I'll make it disappear
Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now
When I'm missing you I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you
Sunny days that left my skin blood red
And you squeeze me 'til these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
This loves too overrated
See what's going on, on
Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now
When I'm missing you I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you
Take me back to live at home, take me back to Albert Road
Now I'm missing you, I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed in to your dress so I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too
I thought I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you
And I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed in to your dress so I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too
