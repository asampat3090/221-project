I was walking home from school on a cold winter day.
Took a shortcut through the woods, and I lost my way.
It was getting late, and I was scared and alone.
When a precious baby boy took my hand and led me home.
Mama couldn't see him, but he was standing there.
And I knew in my heart, he was the answer to my prayers.
Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live,
To teach us how to give,
To guide us with the light of love.
When life held troubled times and had me down on my knees
There's always been someone there to come along and comfort me.
A kind word from a stranger to lend a helping hand.
A phone call from a friend just to say I understand.
And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope?
Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live,
To teach us how to give,
To guide us with the light of love.
They wear so many faces,
Show up in the strangest places.
To grace us with their mercy in our time of need.
Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live,
To teach us how to give,
To guide us with the light of love
