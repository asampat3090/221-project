How It Be
Can anybody here
Tell me
Oh tell me
How it be
Tell me
How it be
How it be true
That someone, yes someone
That means you
Could lie to me oh lie to me
How it be?
Get my hopes up so much yes
That there be, something there for me
Something new, something shiny
I am so blue
How it be?
Tell me
Oh tell me
How it be
I thought there would be something here
Something I didn't know before
I thought you could open my eyes
To something new, for me down here
To load down here
But you lied, oh you lied
Then I cried, you lying liar
There's nothing here for me
The bird, man, is gone, or never existed
How it be?
