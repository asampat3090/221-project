Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause, a lost, lost cause
Wait, all this time that I have spent away
Makes me think that I might be okay
The kiss of death will have to wait
My head is holding on to all those things you said
You taught me to be strong and get through it
The mist of darkness in my head
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause, a lost, lost cause
Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found
You are here to make it safe and sound
Oh, we can make it out alive
Fate hath its way when all that's learned is sin
Nothing really matters in the end
As long as you are with me, friend
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause, a lost, lost cause
No one can understand me
Like you can understand
No one can fill your shadow
'Cause you are all I am
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause, a lost, lost cause
