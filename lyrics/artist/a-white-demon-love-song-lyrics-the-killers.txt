rock
White demon love song down the hall
White demon shadow on the road
Back up your mind, there is a call
He isn't coming after all of this time
She likes the way he sings
White demon love song's in her dreams
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?
White demon sorrow will arrange
Let's not forget about the fear
Black invitation to this place that cannot change
While strangely holy, come pouring rain
Darling
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friends go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friends go?
Let us be in love
(Let us be in love)
Let's do old and gray
(Let's do old and gray)
I won't make you cry
(I won't make you cry)
I will never stray
(I will never stray)
I will do my part
(I will do my part)
Let us be in love tonight
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friends go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friends go?
Stand it anymore, darling
Stand it
I can't stand it anymore, darling
Stand it
