Crazy
Baby, I'm so into you
You got that somethin', what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you
Every time I look at you, my heart is jumpin'
What can I do?
You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
You drive me crazy
Sing it!
Oh, crazy
Yeah!
Stop!
You drive me crazy, baby
Excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, oh, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Sing it!
Crazy
Crazy
You drive me crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
