Now you told me on a Sunday that it wasn't gonna work
I tried to cry myself to sleep 'cause it was supposed to hurt
We sat next to the fire as the flame was burning out
I knew what you were thinkin' before you'd say it aloud
Don't say you're sorry 'cause I'm not even breaking
You're not worth the time that this is taking
I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie
Every time you lie
Every time you lie
I woke up the next morning with a smile on my face
And a long list of gentlemen happy to take your place
Less trashier, much classier then who you prove to be
How long's it gonna take before you see that she's no me, oh no no
I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars oh no no
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie
At night awake
I won't be sleeping 'til morning breaks
That's the price you pay for your mistakes
Goodbye to dreaming
So don't say you're sorry 'cause I'm not gonna listen
I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars oh no no
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie
Every time you lie
Don't say you're sorry
Every time you lie
Don't say you're sorry
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie
