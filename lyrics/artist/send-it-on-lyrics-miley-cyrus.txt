A word's, just a word
'Till you mean what you say
And love, isn't love
'Till you give it away
We've all got to give
Yeah something to give
To make a change
Send it on
On and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark stars a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it Strong
Shine a Light and Send it On
Just smile (just smile)
And the world (and the world)
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
That's meant for one will become two
If we take the chances
And change circumstances
Imagine all we can do
If we...
Send it on
On and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark stars a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it Strong
Shine a Light and Send it On
Send it on
There's Power in all of the choices we make
So i'm starting now there's not a moment to wait
A word's, just a word
'Till you mean what you say
And love, is no love
'Till you give it away
Send it on
On and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark stars a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it Strong
Shine a Light and Send it On
Send it on
Send it on
On and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be apart
Reach your heart
Just one spark stars a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will help things start
Make it Strong
Shine a Light and Send it On
Shine a Light and Send it On
Shine a Light and Send it On
