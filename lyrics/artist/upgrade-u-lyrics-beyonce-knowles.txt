Yeah B, talk ur shit, partner let me upgrade u
How u gon' upgrade me? What's higher than number one?
U know I used to beat that block and now I be's the block
Partner let me upgrade u
I hear u be the block but I'm the life that keeps the streets on
Notice u the type that like to keep them on a leash tho'
I'm known to walk alone but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, u need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip, or a ego
But what u think they all mad at me fo'?
U need a real woman in ur life
(That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly
(That's a good look)
And I'ma help u build up ur account
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look)
(But ladies that's a good look)
Believe me
When ur in those big meetings for the mils
(That's a good look)
U take me just to compliment the deal
(That's a good look)
And anything u cop I split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look)
(But ladies that's a good look)
Believe me

I can do for u what Martin did for the people
Ran by the man but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that ur blessed to find ur equal
Still play my part and let u take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever u need me
I see ur hustle, with my hustle I can keep u
Focused on ur focus, I can feed u
U need a real woman in ur life
(That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly
(That's a good look)
I can help u build up ur account
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look)

I be's the D-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, Bubbles Loraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big ballin' baby when I'm caught in u
I'm talking spa bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors u on the verge of a new marriage
'Cuz that rock on ur finger's like a tumor
U can't fit ur hand in ur new purse
It's humorous to me they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island hoppin' off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov baby u ever seen satin?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
U sure to see stars, this is high level not eye level
My bezzle courtesy of Audemars
I'll order urs tomorrow now look at the time I saved u
Mama let me upgrade u
Just when u think u had it all
Big ends, car notes, collectin' cars
Picture ur life elevated with me
Make u my project celebrity
I'll keep ur name hot in the streets
It's the little glimpse of light
That makes the diamond really shine
And u already is a star but unless ur flawless
Then ur dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me
