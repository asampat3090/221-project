Hey
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky but I like it
Listen
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except she got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
Oh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey, those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky but I like it, yeah
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
Well, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey, those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows
Now dance
Little girl
You're freaky but I like it
Hot damn
Let me put my funk on the guitar one time
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned
I think that she knows, think that she knows
I think that she knows, think that she knows
I think that she knows, think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
And I, I'm love stoned from everywhere
And she knows, I think that she knows
And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I
I'm love stoned and I could swear
That she knows, I think that she knows
She knows, she knows
