Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there
And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there
You know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way
'Cause over there, there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a coupla cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead
Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way
But I said no, oh no
Well oh you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No I won't go, oh no no
Well over there there's friends of mine
What can I say, I've known 'em for a long long time
And yeah they might overstep the line
But I just cannot get angry in the same way
No not in the same way, so not in the same way
Oh no, oh no no
