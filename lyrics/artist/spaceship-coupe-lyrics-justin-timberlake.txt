Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, I wrote this song for you
Listen
Everybody's looking for the flyest thing to say (Flyest thing to say)
But I just wanna fly (Fly away with you, you, you, you)
I don't wanna be the one to alienate, yeah (Alienate)
You see, I'm trying to find an alien in you, you, you, if it's cool, cool)
We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (Me and you)
And with the top down we'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Would you like that?
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (Me and you)
And with the top up you wrap up
In my space lover cocoon.
And I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me
Now everybody knows that you're from outer space (Outer space)
But honey, I just want to turn out this space with you (You, you, you, you)
So drive me to your galaxy where I could play, yeah (That milky way)
And sugar I'll take my time
And show you the backseat view, view, if it's cool, cool
We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (And that's me and you)
And with the top down we'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon (Love on the moon)
Hop into my spaceship coupe (Spaceship coupe)
There's only room for two (Me and you)
And with the top up you wrap up
In my space lover cocoon.
And I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Go on and sing to me
Now break it down
Hey, this is the part
Where you and me and all of the stars collide tonight
This is the part
Where we take off
And then we fly far away, far away, far away
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (Me and you)
And with the top down we'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (Me and you)
And with the top up you wrap up
In my space lover cocoon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, can't you see all the stars?
They shine, they shine
Just for you
I said oh, yeah, yeah
Just hop into my spaceship coupe
I saved a seat for you
Right here next to me
I'm gonna take you to the moon
And I'll make you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And you love it when I make you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby this is the part
Where you and me and all of the stars collide tonight
This is the part
Where we take off
And then we fly far away, far away, far away
