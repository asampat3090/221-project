I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that, and something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
I was here...
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here...
I want to say I lived each day, until I died
I know that I let something in, somebody's life
The hearts I have touched, will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I was here...
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I was here...
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here...
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone to hapiness
Left this world a little better just because...
I was here...
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here...
I did, I've done
