I'll make you believe?
I heard you're looking for somebody to treat you right
Cause them other guys dont live up to that hype
I heard you're looking for somebody to smack your heart
Cause they goin they shot before you start
You ain't gotta search no further, I got what you want
(right here)
Im not tryna waste your time
By telling you what you want (right here)
They can make you promises but I
I'll make you believe
Believe, believe, believe, eeeve
Believe, believe, believe, eeeve
Believe, believe, believe, eeeve
They can make you promises but I
I'll make you believe
I heard you're looking for somebody to take control
Baby give me the green light and we'll go
So let me love you
Till my heart stops
Let me touch you
When the beat drops right there
You aint gotta search no further, I got what you want
(right here)
I'm not tryna waste your time
By telling you what you want (right here)
They can make you promises but i
I'll make you believe
that dalilah halim is my love -ev ever
Believe, believe, believe, eeeve
Believe, believe, believe, eeeve
Believe, believe, believe, eeeve
They can make you promises but i
I'll make you believe
