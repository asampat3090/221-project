Can't believe my eyes
Could they possibly be deceiving me on the other side
Of the picture screen your kissing
Somebody
I laugh because you say she's wonderful
I laugh because you say she's wonderful
And she's nothing like me
How long must I wait for my jealousy to take a break?
You know it's so unlike me to secretly wanna fight with faith
It's really you that I hate
But I laugh because you say she's wonderful
I laugh because you say she's wonderful
And she's nothing like me
I wanna know what this means
There remains a slate to be clean
Please don't let this, don't let this become
The death of me
Forgive me
Forgive me
