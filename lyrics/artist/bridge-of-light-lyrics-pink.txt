Just when you think
Hope is lost
And giving up
Is all you got,
Blue turns black,
Your confidence is cracked,
There seems no turning back from here
Sometimes there isn't an obvious explanation
Why the holiest hearts can feel the strongest palpitations
That's when you can build a bridge of light,
That's what turns the wrongs all right
That's when you can't give up the fight
That's when love turns nighttime into day,
That's when loneliness goes away,
That's why you gotta be strong tonight,
Only love can build us a bridge of light
When your feet are made of stone
You're convinced that you're all alone
Look at the stars instead of the dark
You'll find your heart shines like the sun
Let's not let our anger get us lost
And the need to be right comes at way too high a cost
That's when love can build a bridge of light
That's what turns the wrongs all right
That's when you know it's worth the fight
That's when love turns nighttime into day
That's when loneliness goes away,
That's why you gotta be strong tonight
'cause only love can build us a bridge of light
Deep breath, take it on the chin
But don't forget to let love back in
That's when love can build a bridge of light
That's what turns the wrongs all right
That's when you can't give up the fight
That's when love turns nighttime into day,
That's when loneliness goes away
That's why you gotta be strong tonight
'cause only love can build us a bridge of light
Only love can build us a bridge of light...
Of light...
Of light...
