See you down there everyday
Trying to find a different way
To build some kind of ladder to the sky
Trying to find some way to see
Secrets of eternity, and they don't come all at once
And you don't know why
Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name
While all the while I'm trying to open up your heart
See you when you cry yourself to sleep
It's tearing me apart
I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
Someday you'll understand,
Don't you lose your faith in me
I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
I know that you're waiting for,
A chance to come in from the war
If only a moment, if only a day
A place where you feel safe and warm
A sanctuary from the storm
Until all of these questions fade away
But I cannot count on all the signs
You've passed away as mere coincidence
And I'm running out of ways to break through
Like a lonely lover, Waiting by the ocean
I'll never give up on you
I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
Someday you'll understand,
Don't you lose your faith in me
I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
