[Verse 1]
Well hello sir, we look for monday,
Confident we'll get there someday,
Pushing all the papers to a wealthy man,
Might I say, a beautiful tie you wear,
and how do you find such lovely polka dots and stripes these days?
[bridge]
Break all my thoughts hit the floor,
like im makin the score,
im the king of the world,
im a popular man
count by zero's to ten,
if you cant, well i can,
dont let any one wake me
[chorus]
Im dreamin out loud,
dreamin out loud,
and all at once its so familiar to see,
Im dreamin out loud,
dreamin out loud,
cant find a puzzle to fit into piece of apart of me
[verse 2]
Curtain calls a sanctuary,
Actors in the cloth, they freak me out,
Mockin my purpose, in the magazines,
Famous how they make you feel grand,
they're always there to hold your hand,
in times of trouble, they're best of friends
[bridge]
Break all my thoughts hit the floor,
like im makin the score,
im the king of the world,
im a popular man
count by zero's to ten,
if you cant, well i can,
dont let any one wake me
[chorus]
Im dreamin out loud,
dreamin out loud,
and all at once its so familiar to see,
Im dreamin out loud,
dreamin out loud,
cant find a puzzle to fit into piece of apart of me
[bridge]
they dont care what you say
they dont care what you think
all they care, what you do,
long as your of beat,
take a look at yourself
storm tries to come and wreck my world,
no i wont let it
stumble to escape, through anchored drapes, made of bedding
[chorus]
Im dreamin out loud,
dreamin out loud,
and all at once its so familiar to see,
Im dreamin out loud,
dreamin out loud,
cant find a puzzle to fit into piece of apart of me
well hello sir we look for mondaysss
