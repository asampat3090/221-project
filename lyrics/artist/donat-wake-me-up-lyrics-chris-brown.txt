(Intro)
Dearly beloved,
If this love only exists in my dreams,
Don't wake me up
Too much light in this window, don't wake me up,
Only coffee no sugar, inside my cup,
If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss,
I wasn't finished dreaming, about your lips
Don't wake me up up up up up up,
Don't wake me up up up up up up,
Don't wake me up up up up up up,
Don't wake me up, don't wake me,
Don't wake me up (girl)
Don't wake me up,
Don't wake me up (yeah)
Don't wake me up up up up up up,
Don't wake me up, don't wake me
So much life in the city, you won't believe,
Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep,
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed,
Tell me what is the music, inside my head,
Don't wake me up up up up up up,
Don't wake me up up up up up up,
Don't wake me up up up up up up,
Don't wake me up, don't wake me,
Don't wake me up (girl)
Don't wake me up,
Don't wake me up (yeah)
Don't wake me up up up up up up,
Don't wake me up, don't wake me
I don't wanna fall fall fall fall asleep no,
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you,
I don't wanna fall fall fall fall asleep no,
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you,
Don't wake me up (girl)
Don't wake me up,
Don't wake me up (yeah)
Don't wake me up up up up up up,
Don't wake me up, don't wake me
