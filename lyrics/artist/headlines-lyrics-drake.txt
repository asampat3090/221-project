Drake
hiphop
[Verse 1]
I might be too strong out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck, and stop fearing the consequence
Drinking every night, because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they saying I'm back, I agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, please don't do it
Cause one of us goes in, then we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gone pay it
Those my brothers I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know
[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise, fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide, now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind
Then she want to ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like why I got to be all that but still I can't deny the fact
That it's true, listening to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gonna hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even got to say it, they know
[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise, fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide, now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
[Verse 3]
I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind
(Mind, mind, mind)
Tell them I apologize, It happened over time
(Time, time, time, time)
They know
