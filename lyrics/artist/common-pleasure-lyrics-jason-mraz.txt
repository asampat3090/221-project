I remember when we used to walk together
Used to talk together, go to the park together
In all kinds of weather we would share
This common pleasure with most of human kinds
It was a kind of treasure, one that I was surely glad to find
But I got one right here and I'm okay
I'm okay, and you're okay, and we're okay
I'm alright, everything else is alright sometimes
Just remember those bones they get broken
And love is not a token of affection
It's not even a real thing, it's a word
So don't you try to buy it out with a ring
'Cause it's a verb to love someone
Open up and let them in
Just don't be afraid to set them free again
That I ain't ever seen
I'm gonna keep on keeping on
I'm gonna reap on being strong
I got my head on, though mis connected
It's alright 'cause I do it protected
I got a day job, I drive a cheap ride
Sounds like I'm gonna fine
You only get one life to learn
There's only so many brain cells that you can burn
And life can take a turn and take away that you've earned
And leave you yearning for more, so much more
Life is gonna leave you yearning for more, more, more
Your stomach's gonna be churning
Wanting more, you're wanting, wanting some more
You're wanting some more, more, more
Do you want some?
Well, I got some right here and I'm okay
I'm okay and you're okay, ha ha, we're okay
Everything else will be fine sometimes
Guess what I'm doing okay
