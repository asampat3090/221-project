The%20Killers
rock
It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess that changed my mind
And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night
The star maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down"
It's all in your mind
Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap
And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim
And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh what a lonely night
The star maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down"
It's all in your mind
The star maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down"
It's all in your mind
My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
I'm fine but I hear those voices at night sometimes
The star maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down"
It's all in your mind
The star maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down"
It's all in your mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
