Paramore
rock
Somehow everything's gonna fall right into place
If we only had a way to make it all fall faster every day
If only time flew like a dove
Well God, make it fly faster than I'm falling in love
This time we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming "Hallelujah!"
We'll make it last forever
Holding onto patience wearing thin
I can't force these eyes to see the end
If only time flew like a dove
Well, we could watch it fly and just keep looking up
This time we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming "Hallelujah!"
We'll make it last forever
And we've got time on our hands
Got nothing but time on our hands
Got nothing but, got nothing but
Got nothing but time on our hands
This time we're not giving up
Oh, let's make it last forever
Screaming "Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"
