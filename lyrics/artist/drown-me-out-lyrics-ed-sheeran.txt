I'm in so deep Omar Eds can relate to my situation its so real,
Pain ain't the emotion I wanna feel but I'm thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I'll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about just me myself and my shadow
im paro, running out of ammo, and it seems everybody around me is on the same path so it's narrow
Then less than a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise how we ever gonna get so clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind's infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
oh-o-oh
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It seems the way you look back, should of, would of could of but I bet you can't bring shit with a good back
Back to fifteen our face to myself, then I'm more than a hood track

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
Youuuuu won't drown me out

You can't ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around 6'1, 10 stone
I never seen someone drown with insufficient amount of liquid in my lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking? Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking?
I'm floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's so many years, but I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it's in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this aint no tug a war, still don't get roped in the open, I don't wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I'ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don't wanna see this guy survive.

Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
