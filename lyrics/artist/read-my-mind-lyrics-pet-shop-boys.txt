On the corner of main street
Just tryin' to keep it in line.
You say you wanna move on and
You say I'm falling behind.
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
I never really gave up on
Breakin' out of this two-star town.
I got the green light,
I got a little fight.
I'm gonna turn this thing around.
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
The good old days, the honest man;
The restless heart, the Promised Land,
A subtle kiss that no one sees;
A broken wrist and a big trapeze.
Oh well I don't mind, if you don't mind.
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go, can you read my mind?
Its funny how you just break down,
Waitin' on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soakin' my spine.
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
The teenage queen, the loaded gun;
The drop dead dream, the Chosen One,
A southern drawl, a world unseen;
A city wall and a trampoline.
Oh well I don't mind, if you don't mind
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you jump,
tell me what you find when you read my mind.
Slippin in my faith until I fall.
You never returned that call.
Woman, open the door, don't let it sting
I wanna breathe that fire again.
She said I don't mind, if you don't mind
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine.
Put your back on me,
Put your back on me,
Put your back on me.
The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun.
Can you read my mind.
