rock
Please speak softly
For they will hear us
And they'll find out
Why we don't trust them
Speak up dear
'Cause I cannot hear you
I need to know
Why we don't trust them
Explain to me
This conspiracy against me
And tell me how
I've lost my power
Where can I turn?
'Cause I need something more
Surrounded by uncertainty
I'm so unsure of
Tell me why
I feel so alone
'Cause I need to know
To whom do I owe
Explain to me
This conspiracy against me
And tell me how
I've lost my power
I thought
That we'd make it
Because you said
That we'd make it through
And when
All security fails
Will you be there
To help me through?
Explain to me
This conspiracy against me
And tell me how
I've lost my power, how?
I've lost my power
