[Hook: Chris Brown]
It's your fantasy
And you got, you got me
Wanting to do it
And I'm about to prove it
Baby I want to know
Can you love me
You know I'd do anything girl
I don't wanna waste your time
I'll put my heart on the line for you
[Verse 1]
It's the middle of the night
We in the middle of life baby
So let your hair down
Nobody's around
We're making love, just face it
Girl, right now I feel you
Can you pull me closer baby
This shit right here, If your looks could kill
Baby go crazy, I'm gonna control it
[Bridge]
I love the way you throw it
I love the way you throw it
I love the way you make love
I love the way you jump up on it
Bring that ass right here
Bring that ass right here
Baby you're so amazing, call me crazy
I'll give it all up for you, what you wanna do?
Girl it's a dream but you're not asleep
Tonight we're making history
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Girl, I know you wanna stay (stay with me)
I can tell by the way you move your waist (stay with me)
Oh girl, I can't wait, I can't wait
You're about to sweat off your makeup
I'mma take my time, so baby you don't have to worry
I got you for life
[Bridge + Hook]
[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I wanna, lick lick lick you from your head to your toes
And have you begging all night for mercy
Looking like a tall glass full of water in a 100 degrees
You got a nigga so thirsty
Let me chase that, let me taste that
Lay back, way back, like Diddy baby take that
Get you wetter than the great lakes
Take a vacay to place where your booty you can shake that
And erase, Henny gettin' all the stress in your mind knowing you're my one & only
Take off everything, but you boots
Saddle up, ride it like a pony
Girl, you, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, kn-kn-kn-know wh-what's your fanta-tasy
Luda!
[Hook]
