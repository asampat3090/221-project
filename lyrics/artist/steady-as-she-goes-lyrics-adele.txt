Find yourself a girl
And settle down
Live a simple life
In a quiet town
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
Your friends have shown
A kink
In the single life
You've had
Too much to think
Now you need a wife
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter
What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell
So steady as she goes
When you have completed
What you thought
You had to do
And your blood's
Depleted
To the point
Of stable glue
Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter
What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell
So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes
Settle for a girl
(Settle for a girl)
Neither up or down
(Neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd
(Sell it to the crowd)
That is gathered round
(That is gathered round)
Settle for a girl
(Settle for a girl)
Neither up or down
(Neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd
(Sell it to the crowd)
That is gathered round
(That is gathered round)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she go
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
