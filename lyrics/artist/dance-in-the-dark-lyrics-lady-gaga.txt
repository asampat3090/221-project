pop
Silicone, saline, poison, inject me, baby
I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch
Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess, now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
Run, run her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights away while she's howlin' at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still kills the dance
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
In the dark, she loves to dance in the dark
In the dark, she loves, she loves to dance in the dark
Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia, tell 'em how you feel, girls
Work your blond, Benet Ramsey will haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart
Diana you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark, baby
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
