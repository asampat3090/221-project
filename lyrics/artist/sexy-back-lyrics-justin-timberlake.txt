pop
I'm bringin' sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special, what's behind your back
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
Dirty babe
You see these shackles, baby
I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
[Chorus]
Come here, girl (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Come to the back (Go 'head, be gone with it)
VIP (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Drinks on me (Go 'head, be gone with it)
You see what you're twerking with (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Look at those hips (Go 'head, be gone with it)
You make me smile (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Go 'head, child (Go 'head, be gone with it)
And get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on
I'm bringin' sexy back
Them other fuckers don't know how to act
Girl, let me make up for all the things you lack
Because you're burning up, I got to get it fast
(Take it to the bridge)
Dirty babe
You see these shackles, baby
I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
[Chorus]
(You ready? You ready? You ready?)
I'm bringin' sexy back
You mother fuckers watch how I attack
If that's your girl, better watch your back
'Cause you're burning up for me, and that's a fact
(Take it to the chorus)
[Chorus]
(Are you ready, yes? Are you ready, yes?)
