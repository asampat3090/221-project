I took a walk on a Saturday night
Fog in the air
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
Shaking hands run through my hair
My fears, where do I go from here?
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
Weve been missing each other
Weve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
Weve been missing each other
Weve been missing each other
Walking down to the water's edge
Asking why Im here instead of home
Now I stand alone
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel its side
with his
like you were here with me
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
Weve been missing each other
Weve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
Weve been missing each other
Weve been missing each other
Oh, it's on the warmest night
It's in the brightest light
It's when the world is moving
Oh, it's in the faintest cry
It's in the lover's eye
Is when I need you most
And don't you know?
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
Weve been missing each other
Weve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
Weve been missing each other
Weve been missing each other
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
Weve been missing each other
Weve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
Weve been missing each other
Weve been missing each other
