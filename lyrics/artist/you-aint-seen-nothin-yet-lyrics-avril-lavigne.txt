First glance
You nearly made my jaw drop
First dance
And you were looking so hot
Held hands
And moved in for a lip lock
Don't stop baby
Don't stop baby
First taste, like honey
You were so yum
Can't wait for a second
'Cause it's so fun
Third base
And head it for a homerun
Don't stop baby
Don't stop baby
Now hold on tight
To this roallercoster ride
And if you're lovin' this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
And just let go
If you don't, we'll never know
So if you're lovin' this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
My place, you showed up with flowers
Your face, could stare at it for hours
Can't wait to see your super powers
Don't stop baby
Don't stop baby
Your car, I'm sitting right beside you
A rock star at everything that you do
My heart is ready for the next move
Don't stop baby
Don't stop baby
Now hold on tight
To this roallercoster ride
And if you're lovin' this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
And just let go
If you don't, we'll never know
So if you're lovin' this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
To this roallercoster ride
And if you're lovin' this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
And just let go
If you don't, we'll never know
So if you're lovin' this
Just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
Yeah yeah, not yet
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
