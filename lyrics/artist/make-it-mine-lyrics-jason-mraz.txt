Wake up everyone
How can you sleep at a time like this
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Listen to your voice
The one that tells you
To taste past the tip of your tongue
Leap in, the net will appear
I don't wanna wake before
The dream is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I, I know it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine
I keep my life on a heavy rotation
Requesting that it's lifting you up, up, up and away
And over to a table at the Gratitude Cafe
And I am finally there
And all the angels they'll be singing
Ah la la la, ah la la la
I la la la la love you
I don't wanna break before
The tour is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I, I'll own it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine
And timing's everything
And this time there's plenty
I am balancing
Careful and steady
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting
Well I don't wanna wait no more
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world
I'm gonna make it mine
Oh yes I'm following your joy
I'm gonna make it mine
Because I, I am open
I'm gonna make it mine
That's why, I will show it
I'm gonna make it mine
Gonna make it mine
Oh mine
Yes I'll make it all mine
