In spite of all the consequence
In spite of all my pride
In spite of little things you said
That hurt me deep inside
I believe your love, I breathe your love
Like the air in the morning
I sleep your love, I salute your love
And I can't get away
Baby, when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby, when the lights go out
I need you
Baby, when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby, when the lights go out
I need you
The lights of all you see
You could have overcome all this
And I still can't get over you
Are you someone I'll forever miss
I believed your love, I can feel your love
And it's all that I wanted
I sleep your love, I salute your love
And I can't get away
Baby, when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby, when the lights go out
I need you
Baby, when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby, when the lights go out
I need you
And there's the dark begins to rain
The sound is heavy on me
Baby, when the lights go out
I need you
Under the spell
I wanna be under your touch
Under the spell
I wanna be under the rush
Baby, when the lights go out
Baby, when the lights go out
Baby, when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby, when the lights go out
I need you
Baby, when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby, when the lights go out
I need you
