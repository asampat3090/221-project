If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra but I know
One plus one equals two
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through
'Cause baby we ain't got nothing without love
Darling you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby
Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
That our love will heal us all
Right now, baby
Make love to me, me, me, me, me, oh, oh
Make love to me
Hey, I don't know much about guns but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gonna die but I hope
That I'm gonna die by you, hey
And I don't know much about fighting but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
And just when I ball up my fists I realize
That I'm laying right next to you baby
We ain't got nothing but love
And darling you got enough for the both of us
Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
That our love will heal us all
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me, oh, oh
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
