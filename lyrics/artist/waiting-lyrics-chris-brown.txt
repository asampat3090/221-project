Baby I just had a long day
I know you done seen my missed calls
I called you a thousand times
I guess you out clubbing, baby
I'm not gon' trip, not gon' say shit
She gon' ask me why
She know I'm hiding all this pain inside
But she never see a nigga cry
Back and forth with the games
Girl, you played me
This ain't what I wanted
She say she only wanna party
Cause she in love with everybody
I said baby
Look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
I said baby
Look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
I'm on a one on one
Lamborghini speeding on the highway of suicide
I'm tryna follow you
I'm scared
You with your girls
It's your night out
Stressing got me looking like a night owl
You a star now, all up on tv
I made you famous cause I put you in the streets
Back and forth with the games
Girl, you played me
This ain't what I wanted
She say she only wanna party
Cause she in love with everybody
I said baby
Look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
I said baby
Look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
I don't want you to leave
Baby, sit down and listen
Let me love ya
That's all I ever wanted to do
Oh na na
And I made you cry a thousand times
When I went missing
Sorry, I hurt you
I just want you to know that
I love you
Back and forth with the games
Girl, you played me
This ain't what I wanted
She say she only wanna party
Cause she in love with everybody
I said baby
Look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
I said baby
Look what you do to me
Girl, I've gone crazy
And you just got me waiting
I'm just waiting for you
