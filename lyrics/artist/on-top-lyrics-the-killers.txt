Remember Rio and get down
Like some other DJ, it's another town
She's been trying to tell me to hold tight
But I've been waiting this whole night
But I've been down
Across the road or two
But now I've found the velvet sun
That shines on me and you
In the back, uh huh
I can't crack we're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
The day is breaking, we're still here
Your body's shaking, and it's clear
You really need it, so let go
And let me beat it, but you know
That I've been down
Across the road or two
But now I've found the velvet sun
That shines on me and you
In the back, uh huh
I can't crack we're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shack, uh huh
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
We bring the bump to the grind, uh huh
I don't mind, we're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shack, uh huh
I can't fake, we're on top, we're on top
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off my bride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth
Or a handshake in the doorway
I look at you and smile because I'm fine
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off my bride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth
Or a handshake in the doorway
I look at you and smile because I'm fine, oh
