Hey, never mind what haters say
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they solders yeah
They couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they
Make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case
And watch my future fade away
You're gonna be a shinin' star
In fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you'll see you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who you are
So live your life
(Hey, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life
(Oh, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life
(Hey, ayy, ayy, ayy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life
(Oh, ayy, ayy, ayy)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (Hey)
My life (Oh) My life (Hey)
My life (Oh) Just livin' my life (Hey)
My life (Oh) My life (Hey)
My life (Oh)
Just livin' my life
I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished
With the spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still'll
Grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with
Their record sales just hollow tip
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow till
I got love for the game
But ay, I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from? Who you know?
What you make? And what kind of car you in?
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you grow up in poverty
Your values is a disarray prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves
All of a sudden, aren't we?
You're gonna be a shinin' star
In fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you'll see you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who you are
So live your life
(Hey, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life
(Oh, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life
(Hey, ayy, ayy, ayy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life
(Oh, ayy, ayy, ayy)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (Hey)
My life (Oh) My life (Hey)
My life (Oh) Just livin' my life (Hey)
My life (Oh) My life (Hey)
My life (Oh)
Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin'
If you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror and keep on shinin'
'Til the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City
Got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha ha
So live your life
