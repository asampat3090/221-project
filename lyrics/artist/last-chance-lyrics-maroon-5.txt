I'm sure that he could give you everything
Stability and diamond rings
All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Hot flesh that you yearn that grab
Pit of your stomach you're still so sad
Oh
Oooo what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance
This may be the last chance (the last chance)
That I get (that I get) to love you (to love you)
ooo ooo ooo
Out of sight not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine
Cause your the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind
Oh
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we tried
But if you showed up at my door
I could give you so much more
Oh
Oooo what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance
This may be the last chance (the last chance)
That I get (that I get) to love you (to love you)
ooo ooo ooo
Ooo what am I gonna do
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance (the last chance)
That you get (that you get) to love me (to love me)
ooooooooo
Oh, you sure don't make it easy to get myself to safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call me so impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive
So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you have
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
Cause it's the only place you'll see my face
Oooo what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
Why don't you wanna dance
Cause this may be the last chance (the last chance)
That I get (that I get) to love you (to love you)
Oooooooo
Ooo what am I gonna do
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
Cause this may be your last chance (your last chance)
That you get (that you get) to love me (to love me)
ooo ooo ooo
Cause this may be the last chance (last chance) that I get (that I get) to love you (to love you)
ooo ooo ooo
To love you (to love you)
ooo ooo ooo
ooo ooo ooo
