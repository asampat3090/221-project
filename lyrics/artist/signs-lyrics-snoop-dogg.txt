I'm not sure what I see, Cupid don't fuck with me
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, noticing no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone
Nigga you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
You ain't no G
It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?
Tell me if it's weed that you need
If you wanna breathe, I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody tripping VIP they can't get in
If something go wrong then you know we get to Cripping
I'm not sure what I see, Cupid don't fuck with me
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone
Nigga you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
You ain't no G
Now you stepping with a G, from Los Angeles
Where the helicopters got cameras
Just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncer cars
You're with you friend right?
(Yeah)
She ain't trying to bring over no men right?
(No)
Shit, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She can get high all in an instant
I'm not sure what I see, Cupid don't fuck with me
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, noticing no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone
Nigga you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
You ain't no G
Mami, mamasita, have you ever, flown on G5's
From London to Ibiza, you gotta have Cape Town
You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena
And I can take you
(Uncle Charlie, preach)
Nigga don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone
And her pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't got that Snoop Doggy Dogg style
I'm not sure what I see, Cupid don't fuck wit me
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, noticing no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone
Nigga you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
You ain't no G, you ain't no G
