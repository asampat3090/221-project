So this is Christmas
And what have you done?
Another year over
And a new one just begun.
So this is Christmas,
I hope you have fun,
The near and the dear one
The old and the young.
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one,
Without any fear.
And so this is Christmas,
For weak and for strong,
For rich and the poor ones,
The world is so wrong.
And so happy Christmas,
For black and for whites,
For yellow and red ones,
Let's stop all the fight.
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear.
And so this is Christmas
And what have we done?
Another year over
And a new one just begun.
Ans so this is Christmas,
I hope you have fun.
The near and the dear one,
The old and the young.
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear.
War is over
If you want it.
War is over now.
War is over
If you want it.
War is over now.
War is over
If you want it.
War is over now.
War is over if you want it,
War is over now.
