Hey! Hey! Hey!
La la la la la
Hey! Hey! Hey!
La la la la la
You come from here, I come from there
You rock out in your room, I rock a world premiere
We're more alike than anybody could ever tell
(Ever tell)
Friday we're cool, Monday we're freaks
Sometimes we rule, sometimes we can't even speak
But we can get up and let loose and LOL
(LOL)
It may seem clich for me to wanna say
That you're not alone
(That you're not alone)
And you can call me uncool but it's a simple fact
I got your back, yeah yeah yeah!
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me, the perfect team
Chasing down the dream
We're one and the same!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
La la la la la
I'm kinda like you, you're kinda like me
When we write the same song in a different key
It's got a rhythm you and me can get along
(Get along)
It may seem clich for me to wanna say
That you're not alone
(Here I go again)
And you can call me uncool but it's a simple fact
I still got your back, yeah!
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me, the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
We're one and the same!
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
We're so good, more than momentary!
'Cause we're one
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)
'Cause we're one
(I think we're almost legendary)
We're anything but ordinary!
You and me, the perfect team
Chasing down the dream, oh
You and me, the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
We're one and the same!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
La la la la la
Hey! Hey! Hey!
