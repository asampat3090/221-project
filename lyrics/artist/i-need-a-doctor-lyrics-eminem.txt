I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
I told the world one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Doubt starting to creep in, everyday is just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say it's whack, they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathing life in me, I owe my life to you
but for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick, you gon' either wanna fight
When I get off this fucking mic or you gon' hug me
But I'm not an option, there's nothing else I can do 'cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy but you're either getting lazy
Or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinion's not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy Dre
I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith, and you ain't giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life, bring me back to life, bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jumpsuit, whole room, cracked jokes
But once you got inside the booth, told you like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said they was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots, and the cracker's ass
Little crackerjack beat, making wack-ass
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they scream, Dre don't leave us like that man 'cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
