She's a fast love professional
Crafty, bold and beautiful
Stage right, lock eyes
I swear it's magical
Her name is Melanie
She says she digs my melody
Likes how I move, thinks I'm cool
That's what she says to me
Big stage, bright lights
Short love, long nights
Freaky flies through the skies
To some stars
I come back to town
She's hanging around
It still feels so real
But it can't go too far
Her favorite colors
Be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo
She only loves in stereo
I should know
'Cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go
She only loves in stereo
Turn on the video
Oh, my goodness there she goes
Now I'm hot, seems I'm not
The only one she knows
Name dropping every day
But I still want her anyway
I like how she moves, think she's cool
My favorite getaway
Big stage, bright lights
Short love, long nights
Deja vu, yeah we do it again
Off to the next town
She's on to the next round
Let it go, we both know
That it's all gonna end
Her favorite colors
Be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo
She only loves in stereo
I should know
'Cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go
She only loves in stereo
She fell in love with the radio
It wasn't really me
So I had to let her go
Just ask any DJ
Back in her hometown
She likes to get around
She's gorgeous, she gets down
Her favorite colors
Be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo
She only loves in stereo
I should know
'Cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go
She only loves in stereo
She loves in stereo
(I think I gotta let her go)
She loves in stereo
(I think I gotta let her go)
She loves in stereo
She loves in stereo
