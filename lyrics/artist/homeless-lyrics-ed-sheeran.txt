Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be (x3)
It's not a homeless life for me
And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
When I feel cold you keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home, less than I'd like to be
