Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters but you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you
But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you
Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me and pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then but now I'm willing to learn
But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you
Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I put my hands up, I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you
