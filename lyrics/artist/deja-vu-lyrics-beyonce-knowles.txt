Baby, seem like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go, baby
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Baby, I can't go anywhere without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true, gotta be having deja vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here, get on the next plane, I don't care
I'm missing you, that I'm having deja vu
Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
