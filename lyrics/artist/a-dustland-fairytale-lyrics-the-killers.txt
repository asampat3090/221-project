The%20Killers
rock
A Dustland fairytale beginning
Or just another white trash county kiss
In '61, long brown hair and foolish eyes
He looked just like you'd want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American Prince
A blue jean serenade and moon river, what you do to me
And I don't believe you
Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was looking for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a palm tonight
Change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She says she always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinking ships
But we persevere, God gives us hope
But we still fear what we don't know
The mind is poison
Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized
A drawbridge is closin'
Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was looking for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I took my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide
Out where the dreams are high
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here, the good girls die
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die
Now Cinderella, don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh, don't you know, the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in '61?
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
I wouldn't dream so high
