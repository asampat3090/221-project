You a bad girl and your friends bad too,
Oh, you got the swag sauce, you dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too,
Oh, you got the swag sauce, you dripping swagu
[chorus]
I may be young but I'm ready
To give you all my love!
I told my girls you can get it,
Don't slow it down, just let it go
So in love I'll give it all away,
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow!
So tonight I'll do it every way,
Speakers knocking til the morning lights!
Chorus:
We like to party, hey, hey, hey! hey! hey! hey!
(We like to party!)
We like to party, hey, hey, hey! hey! hey! hey!
(We like to party!)
Your touch is driving me crazy,
I can't explain the way I feel!
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us!
Just hold me close, don't let me go!
So in love! I don't care what they say!
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow!
Cause tonight is the night, oh, oh, oh
That I give you everything,
Music knocking til the morning light,
Cause we like to party!
Set the scene, 3000 degrees,
Ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there,
But they worried 'bout me.
I got a homeboy name butter and another homeboy that nigga name cheese.
Fuck with me, baby!,
I'll make it milk til it drip down yo knees.
Spit that shit for real o, brain real o.
Kiddo says he looks up to me this just makes me feel old,
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero.
Man we were just in the food court eating guy gyros.
Yesterday that's the way,
Every single morning I try to pray!
Grandmama nem they never forgot, nothing else really means nothing to me.
I ain't stunting to be.
Talking to me?
Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on, there
ain't nothing to see!
Shhh always something to song,
I'm the raw off the rip.
Cause of him all of them will remem the min that they fell in love with rap.
Black like having yo cousin back,
Blue like when that rent is due,
Cream like when I'm loving you!
Yeeaaah
So in love I'll give it all away,
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow!
Cause tonight is the night, oh, oh, oh
That I give you everything,
Music knocking until the morning light,
Cause we like to party!
Chorus:
We like to party, hey, hey, hey! hey! hey! hey!
(We like to party!)
We like to party, hey, hey, hey! hey! hey! hey!
(We like to party!)
You a bad girl and your friends bad too,
Oh, you got the swag sauce you drippin' swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too,
Oh, you got the swag sauce you drippin' swagu
