I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's right
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh no, no, oh no, oh no
Yeah, I've got a feeling
Oh please believe me I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah
And if you leave me I won't be late again
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah
I got a feeling
All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I've been looking for was somebody
Who looked like you
I've got a feeling that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I've got a feeling I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah I've got a feeling, yeah, yeah
Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up
Everybody put their foot down
Oh yeah

Everybody had a good year

Everybody had a hard time
(Oh yeah)
Everybody had a wet dream
(Oh yeah)
Everybody saw the sunshine
(I've got a feeling)
Everybody had a good year
(A feeling I can't hide)
Everybody let their hair down
(Oh no)
Everybody pulled their socks up
(Oh no no)
Everybody put their foot down, oh yeah
I've got a feeling
I got a feeling
Oh yeah
I got a feeling, yeah
Oh my soul, so odd
