Im broken, do you hear me?
Im blinded, cause you are everything I see,
Im dancin alone, Im praying,
That your heart will just turn around,
And as I walk up to your door,
My head turns to face the floor,
Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say,
[Harry]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just wont feel right,
Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just dont feel right,
Cause I can love you more than this,
Can love you more than this
[Niall]
If Im louder, would you see me?
Would you lay down
In my arms and rescue me?
Cause we are the same
You save me,
When you leave its gone again,
[Louis]
And when I see you on the street,
In his arms, I get weak,
My body fails, Im on my knees,
Prayin,
[Everyone]
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
It just wont feel right,
Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,
When he lays you down,
I might just die inside,
It just dont feel right,
Cause I can love you more than this, yeah,
[Zayn]
Ive never had the words to say,
But now Im askin you to stay
For a little while inside my arms,
And as you close your eyes tonight,
I pray that you will see the light,
Thats shining from the stars above,
(And I say)
