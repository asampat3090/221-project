I'm bringin' sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special what's behind your back
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
(Take em to the bridge!)
Dirty babe
You see these shackles? Baby, I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
(Take em to the chorus!)
Come here girl
(Go head be gone with it)
Come to the back
(Go head be gone with it)
