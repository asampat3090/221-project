[Intro: Chris Brown]
Babyyyy
Yeah
Mustard on the beat ho
[Bridge 1: Chris Brown]
Baby let me put your panties to the side (uh)
I'mma make you feel alright (right, right)
'Cause I'mma give you what you need, yeah
Mami you remind me of something (uh)
But I don't know what it is (I don't know)
Cause you remind me of something (uh)
Girl you gotta show me (alright)
You remind me of something (uh)
But I don't know what it is right now (I don't know)
You remind me of something (uh)
Girl you gotta show me
[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, on the real no lie
I don't know what it is but you just my type
Everything just right, B said put it to the left
Don't listen to the hype though
Got a cup in your hand
Baby sitting but you ain't got no kids
We ain't leaving 'til there ain't no more left
Can't see no time on the Rolex (no)
I could tell you a freak, go show it
Looking for the after party, where to go at?
Go on the floor like a doormat (uh)
Baby you know where to throw that
I said...
[Hook: Chris Brown]
Mami you remind me of something (baby you remind me) (uh)
But I don't know what it is (I don't know)
Cause you remind me of something (uh)
Girl you gotta show me, yeah (alright)
You remind me of something (uh)
But I don't know what it is right now (I don't know)
Cause you remind me of something (uh)
Girl you gotta show me
[Bridge 2: Chris Brown & Kid Ink]
Baby if you know what it is
On a real, can't lie, man you just my type
Hands in the air looking for a bitch right now
On a real, can't lie, man you just my type
[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Uh, so tell me what your name is
I don't really care who you came with (no)
Unless you got a couple friends look like you
My bad if my ex try to fight you
Roll up soon as I roll in
Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't know where to stand
So high, ain't nowhere to land
You remind me of something missing
Misses, you got my full attention
Listen, let go of the tension
If I get a minute, I'll put your bad ass in detention
[Bridge 1]
[Bridge 2]
[Break: Chris Brown]
Oh baby show me, show me something
Tomorrow I might be hungover, but that don't mean nothing
You see all night long, I've been wrong
Baby show me something
She gon' let me do it
[Bridge 1]
