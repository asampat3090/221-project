Baby boy what you done to me
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got a bad boy, I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you and not to mention
Good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No I won't apologize
For feeling like I do
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what your giving me
Boy, it's killing me
When it comes to love I'm not trying share
You might think I'm greedy
But I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize
They might see I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what your giving me
Boy, it's killing me
When it comes to love I'm not trying share
You might think I'm greedy
But I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
Boy, you got me trippin'
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy
So amazing
I don't mean to be demanding
But I hope you're understanding
I'm not playing boy
I'm just saying boy
They might see I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what your giving me
Boy, it's killing me
When it comes to love I'm not trying share
You might think I'm greedy
But I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
Boy, you got me trippin'
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy
So amazing
I don't mean to be demanding
But I hope you're understanding
