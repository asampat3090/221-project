Did you forget that I was even alive?
Did you forget everything we ever had?
Did you forget, did you forget about me?
Did you regret ever standing by my side?
Did you forget what we were feeling inside?
Now I'm left to forget about us
But somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song, you can't forget it
So now I guess this is where we have to stand
Did you regret ever holding my hand?
Never again, please don't forget, don't forget
We had it all, we were just about to fall
Even more in love, than we were before
I won't forget, I won't forget about us
But somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song you can't forget it
Somewhere we went wrong!
We were once so stro-ong!!
Our love is like a song, you can't forget it at all
And at last all the pictures have been burned
All the past is just a lesson that we've learned
I won't forget, please don't forget us
Somewhere we went wrong
Our love is like a song but you won't sing along
You've forgotten about us
Don't forget
