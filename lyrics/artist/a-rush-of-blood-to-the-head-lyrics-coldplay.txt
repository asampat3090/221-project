He said, "I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground"
He said, "I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls"
"Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
And do back the things it did to you in return"
He said, "I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head"
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They said, "Start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on"
He said, "I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
And stand here beside my baby watch the orange glow
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry
You just sit down there and you wonder why"
"So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head, oh to the head"
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say, "Start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on, as you mean to go on"
"So meet me by the bridge, meet me by the lane
When am I gonna see that pretty face again
Meet me on the road, meet me where I said
Blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head"
