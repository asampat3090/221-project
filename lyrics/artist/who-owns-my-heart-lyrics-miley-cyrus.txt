Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancing on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand
I go crazy, yeah
The music tells me what to feel
I like you now, but is it real?
By the time we say goodnight
I'll know if this is right
And I feel you
Coming through my veins
Am I into you?
Or is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart?
Is it love or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving
It's got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love or is it art?
You know, I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?
The room is full, but all I see
Is the way your eyes just blaze through me
Like fire in the dark
We're like living art
And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me?
Or is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart
Is it love or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving
It's got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love or is it art?
You know, I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?
So come on, baby
Keep provoking me, keep on roping me
Like a Romeo, baby, pull me close
Come on, here we go, here we go, here we go
And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me?
Or is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart?
Is it love or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving
It's got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love or is it art?
You know, I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart? Who owns my heart?
Who owns my heart?
