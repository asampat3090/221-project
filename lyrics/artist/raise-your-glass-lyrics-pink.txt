Pink
pop
Right, right turn off the light
We gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealeo?
I love when it's all too much
5 a.m., turn the radio up
Where's the rock and roll?
Party crashers, penny snatchers
Call me up if you a gangster
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud and nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass
Slam, slam, oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out
Can't stop coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now
(It's so fucking on right now)
Party crasher, penny snatcher
Call me up if you a gangster
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud and nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass
Oh shit, my glass is empty
That sucks
So if you're too school for cool
And you're treated like a fool
You could choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own
So raise your, so raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud and nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never be, never be
Anything but loud and nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass for me
Just come on and come and
Raise your glass for me
