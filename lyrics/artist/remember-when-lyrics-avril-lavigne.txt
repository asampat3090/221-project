Remember when I cried to you a thousand times
I told you everything, you know my feelings
It never crossed my mind that there would be a time
For us to say goodbye, what a big surprise
But I'm not lost, I'm not gone
I haven't forgot
These feelings I can't shake no more
This feeling's running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when
I remember when it was 'Together till the end'
Now I'm alone again, where do I begin?
I cried a little bit, you died a little bit
Please say there's no regrets and say you won't forget
But I'm not lost and I'm not gone
I haven't forgot
These feelings I can't shake no more
This feeling's running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when
That was then, now it's the end
I'm not going back, I can't pretend
Remember when
These feelings I can't shake no more
This feeling's running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
