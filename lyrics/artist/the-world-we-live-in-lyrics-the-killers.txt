This is the world that we live in
I feel myself get tired
This is the world that we live in
Well, maybe I was mistaken
I heard a rumor that you quit this day and age
Well, maybe I was mistaken
Bless your body, bless your soul
Pray for peace and self control
I gotta believe it's worth it
Without a victory I'm so sanctified and free
Well, maybe I'm just mistaken
Lesson learned
And the wheels keep turning
This is the world that we live in
I can't take blame for two
This is the world that we live in
And maybe we'll make it through
Bless your body, bless your soul
Reel me in and cut my throat
Underneath the waterfall
Baby, we're still in this, oh, yeah
This is the world that we live in
I feel myself get tired
This is the world that we live in
I had a dream that I was falling down
There's no next time, alone
A storm wastes its water on me
But my heart was free
I guess it's the world that we live in
It's not too late for that
This is the world that we live in
And no, we can't go back
This is the world that we live in
I still want something real
This is the world that we live in
I know that we can heal over time
This is the world that we live in
This is the world that we live in
