rock
Oh, she's only 17
Wind and wind and wound up over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the scene
Brothers frightened and when's a baby gonna sleep
Hidden ship that sails away
Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's the tick of our time and the tick in her hair
That made me feel so strange
So I could call you baby, I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh, it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue
That made me want to stay
Oh, she's only 17
Wind and wind and wound up over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the scene
Brothers frightened when's a baby gonna sleep
Hidden ship that sails away
Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's the tick of our time and the tick in her hair
That made me feel so strange
So I could call you baby, I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh, it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue
That made me want to stay
I could call you baby, I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh, it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue
That made me want to stay
