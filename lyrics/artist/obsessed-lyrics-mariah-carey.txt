I was like, why are you so obsessed with me?
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
All up in the blogs sayin' we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Sayin' we up in your house, sayin' I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be poppin' hood, you get it poppin'
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losin' your mind
It's confusin' you, you're confused, you know
Why you wastin' your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And I'm the lastest thing)
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all the girls say)
Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed
You on your job, you hatin' hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Gaspin' for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waitin'
Tellin' the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you trippin'
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation
Why you so obsessed with me? And boy, I wanna know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losin' your mind
It's confusin' you, you're confused, you know
Why you wastin' your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And I'm the latest thing)
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all the girls sing)
Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed, obsessed
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losin' your mind
It's confusin' you, you're confused, you know
Why you wastin' your time?
Would you love me? Would you love me?
