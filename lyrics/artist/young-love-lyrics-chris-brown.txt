Young love
A teenage love
Young love, yeah
A teenage love
Young love, young love everything I need
I got my young love
A teenage love
Young love
Young love, girl
A teenage love
Tell me what's the definition of love
Seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out but
Every time they fall up in it
They fall out, in and out it again
Tell me how they gonna know about us
Tellin' me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done
I know we can do it because
If it's wild and out, we got that
And forgiving, we got that
If it's talkin' 'bout how we feelin', we got that
And just hanging out, keeping it real then we got that
Me and you know what the deal is but
Since we ain't 21, they be tryna say it ain't love
'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be tryna say we're too young
I ain't sayin' that we're tryna be grown
I'm just sayin' that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky 'cause we got that young love
It's crazy how all our friends say
That we gone they still tryna figure us out, babe
'Cause we always together
And we don't gotta front, we ain't gotta pretend, girl
And you know a couple of them gon' hate, yeah
Talk behind your back and smile up in ya face
Oh girl, we can prove 'em wrong and show 'em how it's done
And girl I know that we can do it just because
If we're wild and out, we got that
Forgiving, we got that
Talkin' 'bout how we feelin', we got that
If it's hanging out, keeping it real then we got that
Me and you will know what the deal is but
Since we ain't 21, they be tryna say it ain't love
'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be tryna say we're too young
I ain't sayin' that we're tryna be grown
I'm just saying that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love, a teenage love
We can hit a show, kick it on the block
Everywhere we go, you know that we got that
Young love, young love, young love, a teenage love
'Cause talking on the phone or laying at the spot
No matter what we do, you know they can't stop that
Young love, young love, young love, a teenage love
Since we ain't 21, they be tryna say it ain't love
'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be tryna say we're too young
I ain't sayin' that we're tryna be grown
I'm just saying that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
Young love, young love
Everything I need I got in my young love
Well, it's my young love, young love
Everything I want I got in my young love
Young love, young love
Everything I need I got in my young love
Well, it's my young love, young love
Everything I want I got in my young love
Young love, young love
Everything I need I got in my young love
