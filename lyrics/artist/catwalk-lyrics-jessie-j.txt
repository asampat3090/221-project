I'm walking down the catwalk,
I can't talk
Can't hide that I'm feeling bored
High heels make me really tall,
But I can't walk
But they still clap like they want more
Switch up to a tight fitted T
And some high top kicks in pink black and green
I wanna dance, I wanna dance,
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna d-d-d-d-d-dance
Switch up to some baggy jeans
And bright coloured boxers for all to see
I wanna dance, I wanna dance,
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna d-d-d-d-d-dance
Work it like a model
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Naomi Campbell
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
You're on a catwalk
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)

I'm going back down the runway
I wanna run away
But it feels like the fun way
I wanna stay, i wanna stay on stage
But it's the time to change,
I'm gonna d-d-d-d-d-do my thing
Switch up to a tight fitted T
And some high top kicks in pink black and green
I wanna dance, I wanna dance,
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna d-d-d-d-d-dance
Switch up to some baggy jeans
Dem bright coloured boxers for all to see
I wanna dance, I wanna dance,
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna d-d-d-d-d-dance
When you're like a model
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Your Naomi Campbell
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
You're on the catwalk
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
