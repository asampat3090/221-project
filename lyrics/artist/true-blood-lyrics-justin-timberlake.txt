Red was the color of her eyes
And she put me in a meditation state
Her skin was white so white
Looked like it had no expiration date
Black is the color of the night
And it's time for feeding and her body waits
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me
When we raise hell I can't stay away
Aw, give it to me now
So evil in your dress
It circulates you start to feel it
Devil in the flesh
Once you start to invoke her spirit
Got you on the floor
She comes alive when your appearing
Hungry for some more
I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon, it's so mean, that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes me say
Now I feel my fever on the rise
In my bones and my body starts to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don't want to escape
All the other ones that have tried
Find out that they have made their final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type
She told me that she found her perfect blood mate
So evil in your dress
It circulates you start to feel it
Devil in the flesh
Once you start to invoke her spirit
Got you on the floor
She comes alive when your appearing
Hungry for some more
I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon, it's so mean, that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes me say
Your pheromones invaded my instinct
I start to seem like an animal
Roast me in your perfection, I'm mad, I don't wanna think
'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle
It feels like
The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle
Ooh sometimes it feels like
I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon, it's so mean, that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes me say
Give it to me, that goes to boogie, that goes to high
Give it to me
Yeah
Now that you got me
Tell me what your gonna do with me
I taste your blood
I found out you was a perfect fit
Mmm, come on mama
Show me what your working with
Mmm, come on mama
Go on show me what your working with
Show me what your working with
Now that you got me
Tell me what your gonna do with me
Cause I can taste your blood
I found out you was a perfect fit
Mmm, come on mama
Show me what your working with
I said come on mama
Go on show me what your working with
Show me what your working with
We got that true blood, she got that, she hit me with that
True blood
