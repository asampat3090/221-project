rock
Fly me to the moon
And let me play amoung the stars
And let me know what love is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words, Darling kiss me
And fill my heart with joy
And let me sing forever more
'Cause you are all I've wanted,
All I've worshipped and all I've adored
In other words please be true
In other words, In other words
In other words, I love you
And fill my heart with joy
And let me sing forever more
'Cause you are all I've wanted,
All I've worshipped and all I've longed for
In other words please be true
In other words, In other words
In other words, I love you
..Something like that
