Is there another guy?
Who I think is cool,
Walking outside my door,
Peeking everyday.
I look at him,
Like he is so poor,
Everytime I eat he will steal,
He is my boy .
There are four Evermore,
Radio stations,
Everywhere that we go.
You think I know,
He is so cute.
He is cool and funkin'.
In the four Evermore.
Is there someone?
That I look onto,
Kiss me on my cheek,
Taking advantage.
I look at him,
Like he is so poor,
Everytime I eat he will steal,
He is my boy.
There are four evermore,
Radio stations.
Everywhere that we go.
You think I know,
He is so cute,
He is so cool and funkin',
In the four Evermore.
