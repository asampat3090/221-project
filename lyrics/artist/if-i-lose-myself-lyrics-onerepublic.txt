I stared up at the sun :)
Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved
I stand up just to see
Of all the faces,
you are the one next to me
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out the window, tonight...
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
Woah, woah , woah
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I...
Lose myself tonight
*Instrumental*

If I lose myself tonight

I lose myself tonight...
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I...
Lose myself tonight
Whooooooo...Whooo ,Awhooo

Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Lose myself
If I lose myself tonight..
Whoooooooooo
whoooooo,whooooooo
