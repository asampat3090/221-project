I remember being young and so brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me Im a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
But now bitches I run this
'Cause I put it (down like that, down like that)
And Im making (all these racks, all these racks)
And Im moving (round like that, round like that)
when I do it (I dont look back, dont look back).
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can do wrong if I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
They love the way I walk
'Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk
'Cause I aint pretending
It took a while, now I understand
Just where Im going
I know the world and I know who I am
'Bout time I show it
'Cause I put it (down like that, down like that)
And Im making (all these racks, all these racks)
And Im moving (round like that, round like that)
when I do it (I dont look back, dont look back).
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (whatever it is)
I'm a grown woman
So I know how to ride it
I'm a grown woman
And I'm so erotic
I'm a grown woman
Look down, got you so excited
I'm a grown woman
Look at my body
It ain't no fun
If a girl can't have none.
You really wanna know how I got it like that
'Cause I got a cute face
And my booty so fat
Go girl (go girl)
She got that bomb (that bomb)
That girl can get whatever she wants.
Go girl (hey girl),
She got that tight (that tight).
Them boys,
They do whatever she like.
