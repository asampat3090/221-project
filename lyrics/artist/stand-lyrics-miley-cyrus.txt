pop
a story of a heart in need
playin on my tv screen
will i sit back and watch it fade?
theres gotta be a better way
love is more than what you feel
love is action love is real
break your silence,turn the key,
and be the change you wanna see
chorus:
so get ready
come on everybody
are you ready to:
chorus2:
stand, for what you believe in
stand,for all that is right
stand,when its dark all around you,
you can be that shinin' light
stand,when troubles come calling
your gonna be alright
stand,just reach deep inside you and be that shinin' light
i feel the earth shake,raise my voice,
i have my soul,i have a choice
i feel it burnin',i want more,
so what am i waiting for?
repeat chorus
