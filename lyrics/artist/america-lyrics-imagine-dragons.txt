Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?
20 years in debt
20 years in the government
20 years can never get me by
Then I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6
The names upon the list
For all the ones that gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free
And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
