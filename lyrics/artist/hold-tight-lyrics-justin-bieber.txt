Happy birthday
They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)
They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best, I've ever had
Not to mention
That thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a zip lock, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm
Like a wrist watch
Oh, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh
They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)
They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)
Got me tossing, turning in the bed
The places where I rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Oh, when you got me in a grid lock
What a great spot
Yeah, that turned up kind of love and it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh we
They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)
They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)
Holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rock star
Making it hard on me
Visualize a monster
'Cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow, I'm hit
Need you right near me
Trying to maintain, so don't mind if I turn away (no, no)
I try to maintain, so don't mind if I turn away
They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)
They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
