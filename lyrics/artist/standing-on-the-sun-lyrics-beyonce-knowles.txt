My body is magnified
In the sun set me alite
My body, in your delites
Burn me up, set me alite
I can't deny, your desire
Feel like Im on fire
When you touch me
I feel the flame backing up my feet
Can you feel the heat on my skin
Can you feel all my loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
Can you feel my heart burning
Can you feel all my good loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the...
Let's get to hugging and kissing
Don't know the floor from the ceiling
When you get up in the kitchen nobody hotter than you
Know that I twerk it
And give you some of that worth it
Work it for daddy that's perfect
This me only for you
Look at that ocean, can't you see it
Mixed up passions with fruit sangria
BB Cubana, ay que lindo
Ya tu sabes, camino como cocino, primo
There's only one thing on my mind
I want to love you long time
Want you to watch me while I whine
Want you to love me long time
We just having such a good time
Over and over we whine
With the flame lit and I kiss you
While the sun kisses me
Can you feel the heat on my skin
Can you feel all my loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
Can you feel my heart burning
Can you feel all my good loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the...
The body turn let me say turn up, turn up
Girl you walk like the sun so you turn up, turn up
Girl your body turn let me say turn up, turn up
Girl you walk like the sun so you turn up, Beyonc ya
Whine for me (echoed and repeated)
Can you feel the heat on my skin
Can you feel all my loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
Can you feel my heart burning
Can you feel all my good loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the...
