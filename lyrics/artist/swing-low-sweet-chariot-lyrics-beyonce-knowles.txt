Swing low sweet chariot
Coming forth to carry me home
Swing low sweet, sweet, sweet chariot, chariot
Coming forth to carry me home, yeah
Swing down chariots, won't you let me ride? Oh
Swing, stop and let me ride
Oh ride me, rock me, Lord
Ooh yeah, I got a home on the other side
Oh, six white horses standin' side by side
Oh, sing, sing
Rock me, rock me
I got a home, hey
Swing low, swing low, swing low and let me ride
Why, oh why, oh why don't you let me ride?
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Let me ride, let me ride, let me ride
Swing down chariots, won't you let me ride?
Oh, swing, stop and let me ride
Rock me, rock me, Lord
Hey
I got a home
You got a home
We got a home
I got a home
I got a home
You got a home
We goin' home
Goin' home
Let's love, sweet love
Sweet chariot
Take me home
Take me home
I'm going home
