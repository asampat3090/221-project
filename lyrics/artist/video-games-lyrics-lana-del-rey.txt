pop
Swingin' in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer
And you say, "Get over here
And play a video game"
I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watchin' me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say youre the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play your video game
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
An' baby, now you do
Singin' in the old bars
Swingin' with the old stars
Livin' for the fame
Kissin' in the blue dark
Playin' pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seein' stars
This is all I think of
Watchin' all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playin' video games
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
An' baby, now you do
Na-now you do, now you do, now you do
Na-now you do, now you do, now you do
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
An' baby, now you do
Na-now you do, now you do, now you do
Now you do
Na-now you do, now you do, now you do
