I do my best to find some kind of clone
I'm givin' it some heart and soul, now
From the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Yeah, we see that fire
From the streets of Babylon
To the road that we've been on now
The kaleidoscope claims another
Chorus:
Whoa oh-oh oh
(Well) this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Whoa oh-oh oh
(Well) this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I could run this race no more
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color
You've seen my worst / Yet you see some hope in me
The black and white sets us free
Like the queen to the rook
Your decision is a sure thing
Honey yeah, a sure thing
No wonder I feel / like I'm missing a heavy load
But no matter what daylight brings to us
We all know
Chorus:
Whoa oh-oh oh
(Well) this is life in color (color)
Today feels like no other (other)
And the darkest grays
The sun bursts, clouds break
Whoa oh-oh oh
(Well) this is life in motion (motion)
And just when I could run this race no more
The sun bursts, clouds break
This is life in color
This is life in color
Today feels like no other
And the darkest grays
Sun bursts, cloud breaks
Whoa oh-oh oh
Well this is life in motion (motion)
Just when I could run this race no more
Sun bursts, cloud breaks
This is life in color
This is life in color
Ooooh ooh
