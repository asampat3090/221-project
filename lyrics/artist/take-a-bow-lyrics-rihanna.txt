Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, standing ovation? Ooh, oh yeah
Yeah y-yeah yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
Youre so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out
Dont tell me youre sorry 'cause youre not
And baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show, really had me going
But now its time to go, curtains finally closing
That was quite a show, very entertaining
But its over now
(But its over now)
Go on and take a bow
Grab your clothes and get gone
You better hurry up before the sprinklers come on
Talking 'bout, Girl, I love you," "You're the one"
This just looks like a rerun
Please, what else is on?
Dont tell me youre sorry 'cause youre not
And baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show, really had me going
But now its time to go, curtains finally closing
That was quite a show, very entertaining
But its over now
(But its over now)
Go on and take a bow
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you
(Goes to you)
For making me believe that you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech out
How about a round of applause?
A standing ovation?
But you put on quite a show, really had me going
Now its time to go, curtains finally closing
That was quite a show, very entertaining
But its over now
(But its over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now
