rock
Huffman don't take no nonsense
He's here to rectify
He's got his black belt buckle
And the red man's fire in his eye
You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
Four kicks who's strutting now?
This party is overrated
But there ain't shit else to do
She's a lovin' on a boy from the city
I'll be lovin' him under my shoe
You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
Four kicks who's strutting now?
