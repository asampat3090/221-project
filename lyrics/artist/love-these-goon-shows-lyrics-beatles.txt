rock
I'm gonna search this town,
from door to door.
The love I crave
I can't find no more.
I got to find my baby,
I declare there ain't no lie.
I ain't had no real good loving
since that woman said goodbye.
You know I hate to see the sun
sinking to the west,
'cos I know my whole life's
gonna be one solid mess.
I got to find my baby,
I declare there ain't no lie.
I ain't had no real good loving
since that woman said goodbye.
Well ever since the day
that she said we were through,
I've been nervous
and shook up too.
I got to find my baby,
I declare there ain't no lie.
I had no real good loving
since that woman said goodbye.
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever do in my life,
is to find that little woman
make her my wife.
I got to find my baby,
I declare there ain't no lie.
I had no real good loving
since that woman said goodbye.
