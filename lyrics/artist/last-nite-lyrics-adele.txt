Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door
Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles
But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand
Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah
Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand
Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah
