[Verse 1]
It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like puttin' fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worried about
Ooh, you know females
And how they like to run their mouths
Wanna be, wanna be, just like, talk like, you
(like you) you (like you)
Misery, misery, best company
Don't let them change your mood
[Chorus]
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back)
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no, I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I might make you mad, so mad
My bad, no, I ain't all bad
[Verse 2]
Between us, they wanna comment
Your worst enemy some time be your best friend
Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, it's proven I don't give a damn
Wanna be, wanna be everything I ought to be to you (to you)
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do
[Chorus]
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back)
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no, I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I might make you mad, so mad
My bad, no, I ain't all bad
