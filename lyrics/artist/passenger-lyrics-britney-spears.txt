I can't let go of control
I can't let go and oh no
Don't know the way you're having me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
I could handover the keys
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it could feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map
Without a map
Without a map
So let's talk a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and got no regret
My co-pilot yeah that's right
Now I can just enjoy the ride
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it could feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map
Without a map
Without a map
And now we're finally falling
Cause I was giving you half now I'm all in
My hands in the air while you're driving
This is living
This is living
This is living
Yeah
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it could feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map
Without a map
Without a map
