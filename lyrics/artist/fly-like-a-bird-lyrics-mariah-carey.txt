Weeping may endure for a night
But joy comes in the morning
Trust Him
Somehow I know that there's a place up above
With no more hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities and suffering
Because I feel the unconditional love
From one who cares enough for me
To erase all my burdens and let me be free to
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now, Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home
Can we recover, will the world ever be
A place of peace and harmony?
With no war and with no brutality
If we loved each other we will find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondent that I feel the need to
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now, Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home
He said, "He will never forsake you
Or leave you alone"
Trust Him
I need You right here right now, Lord
I need You right here by my side
Keep your head up to the sky
With God's love you'll survive
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now, Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now, Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of You by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray You'll come and carry me home
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me home
Carry me higher, Lord
