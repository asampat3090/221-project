Paramore
rock
I don't mean to run
But every time you come around
I Feel more alive, than ever
And I guess it's too much
Maybe we're too young
And I don't even know what's real
But I know I never
Wanted anything so bad
I've never wanted anyone so bad
If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for
If I let you love me
(If I say)
Be the one adored
(It's okay)
Would you go all the way?
(You can stay)
Be the one I'm looking for
Help me come back down
I'm high above the clouds
You know I'm suffocating
But I blame this town
Why do I deny
The things that burn inside?
Down deep I'm barely breathing
But you just see a smile
And I don't wanna let this go
Really I just want to know
If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for
If I let you love me
(If I say)
Be the one Adored
(It's okay)
Would you go all the way?
(You can stay)
Be the one I'm looking for
If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for
Be the one I'm looking for
If I let you love me
(If I say)
See the one adored
(It's okay)
Would you go all the way?
(You can stay)
Be the one I'm looking for
