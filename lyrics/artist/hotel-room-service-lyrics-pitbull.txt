I want everybody to stop what they doing

Now if you know you're with somebody
That you're gonna take the hotel room tonight
Make some noise
Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room
Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room
Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn

But I like your type
And like T.I., it's whatever you like
Bring your girls, just whatever the night
Your man just left, I'm the plumber tonight

We gon' freak some more, but first
Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room
Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn

After party in hotel lobby
Then we off to the room, like vroom
Put them fingers in you mouth, or open up you blouse
And pull that g-string down south
Ooh, okay shawty, one's company
Two's a crowd, and three's a party
Your girl ain't with it, I got somebody
In my nature, she's naughty
Now gimme that sweet
That nasty, that Gucci stuff
Let me tell you what we gon' do
Two plus two, I'm gon' undress you
Then we're gonna go three and three
You gon' undress me
Then we're gonna go four and four
We gon' freak some more, but first
Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room
Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
