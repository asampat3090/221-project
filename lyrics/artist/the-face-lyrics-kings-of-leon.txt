rock
Beneath the dance hall lights
You see my girl so sound
Lights up the ground
If you give up New York
I'll give you Tennessee
The only place to be
The cowboys burning eyes
Don't like the sight of me
Just straight enough to breathe
I like your point of views
So don't you shy away
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
You had me holding on
All of the time in place
Ride out the wave
Bury yourself away
The one and only face
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
