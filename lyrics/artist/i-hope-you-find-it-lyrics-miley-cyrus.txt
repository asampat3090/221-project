These clouds aren't going nowhere, baby
Rain keeps coming down
I just thought I'd try to call you, baby
For you got too far outta town
And I hope that you get this message
That I'm leaving for you
'Cause I hate that you left without hearing
The words that I need you to
And I hope you find it
What you're looking for
And I hope it's everything you dreamed
Your life could be and so much more
And I hope you're happy, wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's gonna change that
And I hope you find it
Am I supposed to hang around and wait forever?
Last words that I said
But that was nothing but a broken heart talking, baby
You know that wasn't what I meant
Call me up, let me know that you got this message
I'm leaving for you
'Cause I hate that you left without hearing
The words that I need you to
And I hope you find it
What you're looking for
And I hope it's everything you dreamed
Your life could be and so much more
And I hope you're happy, wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's gonna change that
And I hope you find it
Whatever it is out there
That you were missing here
And I hope you find it
What you're looking you
And I hope it's everything you dreamed
Your life could be and so much more
And I hope you're happy wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's gonna change that
No, no, no
And I hope you find it
I hope you find it
