We were as one babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'm letting you fly
'Cause I know in my heart babe
Our love will never die, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on and on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
Do do doop
Do do doop do doop da dum
Do do doop dum
Do do doop do doop da dum
I ain't gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably you'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart babe
Our love will never end, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on and on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling,'cause you'll always be my baby
(I know that you'll be back boy)
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder, oh
(I know that)
You'll be right back, baby
Well, baby believe me it's only a matter of time, time
You'll always be apart of me
And I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on and on
(And we will linger on and on)
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
(Ooh baby)
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
You'll always be apart of me
And I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
(No, no)
(You and I will always be)
And we'll linger on and on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
(You and I)
No way you're never gonna shake me
(You and I)
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
(You and I will always be)
