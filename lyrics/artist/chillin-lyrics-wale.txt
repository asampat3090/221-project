Wale
hiphop
Lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me
Look at that, look at how they're lookin' at me
Eyes all sticky like honey on bees
Look at that, look at how they're lookin' at me
DC chillin', PG chillin'
My name Wale, and I came to get it
Came to get it, came to get it
My name Wale
Shit, this how you start off '09
Kickin' in the door, and I'm everybody problem
Stuntin' in some other Jordan Nines
I got Phil Knight talkin' about "how you got them?"
Let's talk about the cars y'all got
You say you got a lotta whips, well I got a lot
I got the right to be cocky
Get so much cut, disc jockeys jock me
You niggas mad that you not me
I remain a Giant, and you Jeremy Shockey
And if you ain't heard me properly
If you speak garbage, then we no capiche
DC chillin', PG chillin', floor to the ceilin'
Stuntin' in my billionaire
Gear on my millionaire friends
That's money on my mind, Wale
Get 'em all, get 'em all, pack it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks
Across the pond, they all know us
International, whoa
Drivin' my car to a foreign place
Lookin' at me, now they know my face
We want it all now, we got all, yes
Look at that, look at how they lookin' at us
Yeah, they keep sayin' whale, but my name Wale
Hoes call me 'Mr. Never Wear The Same Thang'
You redundant, you never ever change
And I'm the same way, MIA
And me, Cool, and Dre get high like planes
Your man Wale in his own damn lane
Can't control the box, you are no Mills Lane
Ain't heard DC since Sardines came
Ha, and I made y'all love it
We don't cop pleas, but y'all don't cop nothin'
Police come around, don't nobody say nothin'
And you be with the cops, you niggas is McLovin'
Dark liquor 'til we busted
'Til I got a buzz a like that nigga Chris Mullen
District of Columbia
You Bernie Mac funny, we ain't scared of none of ya
Get 'em all, get 'em all, pack it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks
Across the pond, they all know us
International, whoa
Drivin' my car to a foreign place
Lookin' at me, now they know my face
We want it all now, we got all, yes
Look at that, look at how they lookin' at us
DC chillin', PG chillin'
My name Wale, and I came to get it
Came to get it, came to get it
My name Wale
Dre pick 'em up, pick 'em up, I'll shut 'em all down
Haters in the crowd, if you see 'em point 'em out
Stacks in my jeans, broads on the scene
Folarin be ballin' for all y'all to see
Ain't I something? The way I'm stuntin'
My material girls give 'em A-Rod money
LV on my luggage
Them mammas gonna hate and I love it, fuck 'em
Lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me
Look at that, look at how they're lookin' at me
Eyes all sticky like honey on bees
Look at that, look at how they're lookin' at me
DC chillin', PG chillin'
My name Wale, and I came to get it
Came to get it, came to get it
My name Wale
