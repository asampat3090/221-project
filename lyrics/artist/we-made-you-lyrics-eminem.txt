Guess Who
Did you Miss me?
Jessica Simpson sing the chorus
Dina Rea (Eminem)
(CHORUS)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
Youre the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
Youre a rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player Who could really blame you (who could really blame you)
We're the ones who made you
(VERSE ONE)
Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac or ant'-acid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic, is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man no dont massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive Gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then Squish it, then pass it to her friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can
Yes he can, can, dont ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Samanthas a 2, Youre practically a 10
I know you want me girl,
In fact I see your grin
(Now come in girl)
(CHORUS)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
Youre the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
Youre a rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player Who could really blame you (who could really blame you)
We're the ones who made you
(VERSE TWO)
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
Sorry Portia, but whats Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my ventolin inhaler and 2 Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Brit frget K-Fed lets cut off the middle man
Forget him or your gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it wont be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl pay them little atten-tion
A little did I mention, that Jennifer's in-
Love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys you give em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim
(CHORUS)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
Youre the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
Youre a rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player Who could really blame you (who could really blame you)
We're the ones who made you
(VERSE THREE)
And thats why my love
You'll never live without,
I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Dont try to deny it baby, Im the only one for you
Damn girl Im beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think thats bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I dont mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth(brrp)
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Lord help us he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think hes about to flip
Jessica rest assure, Supermans here to rescue ya
Can you blame me?
Youre my Amy, Im your Blake
Matter fact make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
(Now break it down girl)
(CHORUS)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
Youre the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
Youre a rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player Who could really blame you (who could really blame you)
We're the ones who made you
So baby, baby
Get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down
Oh Amy, Rehab never looked so good,
I can't wait, Im going back!! HAHA Whooo!
Dr. Dre, 2020, Yeah
