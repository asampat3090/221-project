Damn...
It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see,
That she don't really know
That I'm trying to find a way,
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I...
I don't wanna be,
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground,
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it,
Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost.
I'm already lost.
I wish that I could see,
What is making you
Feel that you should be concerned.
My love is like a gunshot
All it takes is one shot for me to blow it all away.
I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time,
It's gotta be with you and no one else.
Do you notice me,
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it
Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost.
Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous,
By now you should have noticed me.
And what will it take it
To a heavenly because your
drawing chains and
driving me insane!
Chorus:
Girl,I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost.
