My life has been full of mistakes and regrets for that I know
But without you I feel so cold
I'm an idiot for making the mistakes I did but will you forgive me?
Will you forgive me, my love please forgive me.
[Chorus]
Coz since we've met
There is something in my life worth fighting for
God never thought I'd actually find it
But here it is
Here you are
Since we've met
I found myself more then I ever could of
God bless your soul, God bless your soul...
Your life I'm not to certain about the regrets I know of
But with you not here I can't see clear
You found me on that day tattered and ever so lonely
And gave me a little smirk
So please be with me, be with me. My love be with me.
[Chorus]
What would I do without you?
Probably die.
What would I be without you?
A lonely soul
Guys have jerked me round before and I'm well over it but with you here you break my fall.
[Chorus]
Oooooooh yeah. Woaaaaah.
Be mine, be mine, be mine.
Since we've met
I......am.......me.
