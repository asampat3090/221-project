I feel weak, we've been here before,
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth,
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through,
But I honestly can say I still love you,
Maybe we reached the mountain peak,
And there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost the magic piece,
And we're both too blind to find,
Let's start over,
Let's give love their wings,
Let's start over,
Stop fighting 'bout the same old thing,
Let's start over,
We can't let our good love die,
Maybe we can start over,
Give love another life,
I can see that we're not happy here,
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I don't,
And maybe you'll settle, well, I won't,
Maybe we reached the mountain peak,
And there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost the magic piece,
And we're both too blind to find,
Let's start over,
Let's give love their wings,
Let's start over,
Stop fighting about the same old thing,
Let's start over,
We can't let our good love die,
Maybe we can start over,
Give love another life,
I know that this will hurt you,
I know you'll cry,
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie,
I feel I know that's the best for us,
Let's start over,
And let's give love their wings,
Let's start over,
I'm tired of fighting 'bout the same old thing,
Let's start over,
We both know that this love won't die,
Maybe we can start over,
And give love another life.
