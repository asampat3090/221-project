pop
I was born bad
But then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true.
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do...
Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on my wrist, whiskey on my tongue
Before I give back, I gotta get drunk
So get over here, pour me a cold one.
Babe you can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
Sparkling in sequins, say hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers.
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.

Wrong, I know, killing someone
It gets a little easier when you've done it once
You know that I'm fun, you know that I'm young
So tell me your mind, let's get it on.
Babe you can see that I'm danger
Glamorous, but I'm deranged, yeah
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
I said it really nicely so can you be my savior?

I was a dangerous girl
You were too nice for this world
And now I'm back on the prowl
Who wants to give it a whirl?
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
