Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark wishin' you were here turns me crazy
But its you who makes me lose my head
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and turn me into a crumblin' fool
Tell me to run and I'll race if you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you and me gonna leave just hold me closer baby
And make me crazy for you, crazy for you
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils a sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favorite mood
I keep on tryin' fightin' these feelings away
But the more I do the crazier I turn into
Pacin' floors and openin' doors
Hopin' you'll walk through and save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you, crazy for you
