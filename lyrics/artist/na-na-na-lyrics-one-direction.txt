[Verse 1]
[Liam-]
We've got a bit of love/hate
You take me to the edge then you hit the brakes
I-I say it's over one day,
But then I'm crawling back begging you to stay
We make up then we break up all the time
[Liam-]
I'll say that I hate a song, then you'll go request it the whole night long
S-Some people say it's so wrong but even when we fight,
Girl you turn me on
We make up then we break up all the time
[Chorus] All-
We're like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
Always like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
[Zayn-]
No we can't make up our minds
Cause when we think we've got it right
We go na na na
All- (Na na na)
Na na na
All- (Na na na)
[Verse 2][
Liam-]
You wanna party too late
But when I do the same all you do is complain
You know that it drives me insane
But when I get with you girl you make it okay
We make up then we break up all the time
[Chorus] All-
We're like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
Always like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
[Zayn]
No we can't make up our minds
Cause when we think we've got it right
We go na na na
