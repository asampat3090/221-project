rock
So it's over
This time, I know, it's gone
Salt water,
Tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
So it's over
This time, you're flying on
This time, I know no song
Can't stop it slowly burn
Can't stop it slowly going
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
Oh, we have slowly gone
Can't we pour some water on?
