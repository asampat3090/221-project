rock
I wanna say here's to me gonna change the world
Now I wanna play till they kicking down the door
I'll be alright long as I ain't seen it all
And I'mma holding tight to that night we had a ball, we had a ball
Here's to the kids out there smoking in the streets
They're way too young but I'm way too old to preach
They know it all but they still ain't seein' the truth
Just play my song and I'll show it all to you
Either way you caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me with my pants down
My papa's slave had to go and fight the war
He beat 'em all then he took 'em all to court
My papa called and he said you remember me?
Now he's working awful hard in his factory
Either way you caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me with my pants down
We ain't even been to the ocean
We been running barefoot the stream
We been running barefoot through the stream
We ain't even been to the oh
We ain't even been to the ocean
We been running barefoot the stream
We been running barefoot through the stream
We ain't even been to the ocean
