When I was a young boy, I tried to listen
And I wanna feel like that
Little white shadows, blink and miss them
Part of a system, I am
If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan
All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up, oh
Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state
When I was a young boy, I tried to listen
Don't you wanna feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system, a plan
All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up, whoa
Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state
Swimmin' on a sea of faces
Tide of the human races
Oh, an answer now is what I need
See it in the new sun rising
See it break on your horizon
Oh, come on love, stay with me
