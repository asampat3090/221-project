Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Though it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
They know that Santa's on his way (he's on his way)
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this, this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas yeah-yeah
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas oh no-oh-whoa-whoa yeah oh
Oh yeah-yeah
To you (merry Christmas, Merry Christmas)
Oh yeah-yeah
Merry Christmas
