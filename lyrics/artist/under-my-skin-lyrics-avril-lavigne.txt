I cannot find a way to describe it
It's there inside, all I do is hide
I wish that it would just go away
What would you do, you do if you knew
What would you do
(Do)
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable come and take me away
I feel like I am all alone
All by myself I need to get around this
My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you
If I show you, I don't think you'd understand
'Cause no one understands
(Understands, yeah)
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable come and take me away
I'm going nowhere on and on and
I'm getting nowhere on and on
(Take me away)
I'm going nowhere on and on and off
And on and off and on
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable come and take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Break me away
Take me away
