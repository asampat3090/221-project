Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
You took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized the dream
Mmm, mmm, mmm
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful, that I've received
The answer, that Heaven, has sent down to me
You treated me kind
(Yea)
Sweet destiny
(And you know that you did)
And I'll be eternally grateful
(Ohh, ooo, ooo)
Holding you so close to me
(Prayed through the nights)
Prayed through the nights
(So faithfully)
So faithfully
(Faithfully)
Knowing the one that I needed
(No)
Would find me eventually
(Would find me)
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all
Ohh, ooo, ohh, ooo, ohh, ooo, ohh, ooo
That you turned out to be
Mmm, mmm, mmm
