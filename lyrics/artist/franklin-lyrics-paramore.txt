Paramore
rock
And when we get home, I know we won't be home at all
This place we live, it is not where we belong
And I miss who we were in the town that we could call our own
Going back to get away after everything has changed
Could you remind me of a time when we were so alive?
(Everything has changed)
Do you remember that? Do you remember that?
(Everything has changed)
Could you help me push aside all that I have left behind?
(Everything has changed)
Do you remember that? Do you remember that?
So we stand here now and no one knows us at all
I won't get used to this, I won't get used to being gone
And going back won't feel the same if we aren't staying
Going back to get away after everything has changed
Could you remind me of a time when we were so alive?
(Everything has changed)
Do you remember that? Do you remember that?
(Everything has changed)
Could you help me push aside all that I have left behind?
(Everything has changed)
Do you remember that? Do you remember that?
Taking up our time
Taking up our time
Taking up our time
It's taking up our time again
Go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time again
Go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time again
Go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
Taking up our time
Could you remind me of a time when we were so alive?
Do you remember that? Do you remember that?
