You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey
Sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You don't even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans
'Cause they are more distressed
So they say, you've got OCD
And they claim you can barely read
But you say
"Don't bother me with all of your reality"
But it could be so simple
Life should be that simple
I wish it were just so simple
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems
So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
'Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on
You cross your I's and dot your T's
All it goes to show
That it could be so simple
Life should be that simple
I wish it were just that simple
Forget the point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
And it's as simple as it seems
I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to re-evaluate
The possibilities, the situations
The opportunities that are waiting
Oh, the possibilities, oh, I
It could, it could be that simple
Life should be that simple
I wish it were just so simple
You're in a haze
It's just a phase
You know this maze
Is as simple as it seems
We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you to listen please
And focus on, all life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
'Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems
It is all so simple
Just deal with it
