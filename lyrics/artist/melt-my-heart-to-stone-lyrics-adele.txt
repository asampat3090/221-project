Adele
pop
Right under my feet is air made of bricks
It pulls me down and turns me weak for you
I find myself repeatin' like a broken tune
And Im forever excusin' your intentions
Then I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, Im the only one in love
Im the only one in love
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear away right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowin'
Youve burnt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, Im the only one in love
Im the only one in love
Why do you steal my hand
Whenever Im standin' my own ground?
You build me up and leave me there
I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, Im the only one in love
Im the only one in love
