rock
As I walked past my grave in the fog
Observe her form, lying beside the stone
The letters she left in my name
Where I longed to speak the worst of my soul
I watch the tears that run down her face
Drop to the ground without ever knowing that
I crossed a wide ocean of change
Consumed by desperate despair all the way
Yet, despite every hollow remain that I've gone through
The ghost is always you, behind the chapel walls
Where my soul's laid to rest
There within a moment I understood
I the watcher, just a silent silhouette behind the gates
By god, one day, help me forgive myself
Yet, despite every hollow remain that I've gone through
The ghost is always you
She, the conspirator will guide my hands and cleanse my soul
Though I have remained silent, the search is over and I let go
I will find a voice to describe all the horror
Inside of my mind with determination
I'm just a servant to the silence, the silence I despise
Where in my heart beats a guiding voice?
A sullen hand to suffer my choice
And now, to decipher, the moment's gone
I finally understand my fate
And what has to come to be worth the pain
Ride the seas of change whatever I become
[Incomprehensible]
Like me, for that moment her face is gone
Life's lust, my only friend
No more the answers to force my own life to change
I crossed a wide ocean of change
Consumed by desperate despair all the way
Yet, despite every hollow remain that I've gone through
The ghost is always you
Breathing, 'cause the movement when life is gone
Still the silent silhouette, may my search be over and lend me to rest
I felt the anguish in that movement discovering me
But consequently give my tired soul to be separate
As I walked past my grave in the fog
Observe her form, lying beside the stone
