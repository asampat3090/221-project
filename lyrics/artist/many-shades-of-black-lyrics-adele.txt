Go ahead
Go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever's left
And take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No, in fact it's been a wasted year
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees that you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes, be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Let it out
Let it all out, say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream
And shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah, see if I care
See if I stand firm or if I fall
'Cause in the back of my mind
And on the tip of my tongue is the answer to it all
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees that you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes and be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's many shades of black
There's many shades of black
Yeah, everybody sees
And everyone agrees that you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long
Baby, take it as it comes and be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And you cannot take it back
Oh, you cannot take it back
'Cause there's many shades of black
You have many shades of black
You have many, you have many
You have many shades of black
'Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
