[Nicki Minaj:]
Doctor doctor, need you back home, baby
Doctor Doctor, where you at?
Give me somethin'
I need your love
I need your love
I need your lovin'
You got that kind of medicine that keeps me comin'
My body needs a hero
Come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling real low
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me
[Chorus:]
Make me come alive
Come on turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Make me come alive
Come on turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
[Nicki Minaj:]
Oh, you make it, make it right
My temperature is super high
If I scream, if I cry
It's only 'cause I feel alive
My body needs a hero
Come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling weird, oh!
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me
[Chorus:]
Make me come alive
Come on turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Make me come alive
Come on turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
[Bridge:]
You've got my life in the palm of your hands
Come and save me now
I know you can, I know you can
D,D,D,D,Don't let me die young, I just want you to father my young
I just want you to be my docta, we can get it crackin' chiropractor, I, I, I, I
I,I,I I know you can save me
And make me feel alive
[Chorus:]
Make me come alive
Come on turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
