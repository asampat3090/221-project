You've got me feeling like a pantomime
That's why I only love you part time
It's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,
don't you, don't you touch me no more"
You got me feeling like a paradigm
Your friends all want me in the meantime
It's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,
don't you, don't you touch me no more"
Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed
You left me, baby, for another man
He's looking tall, he's got a deep tan
It's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,
don't you, don't you touch me no more"
He's got religious with the rhinestones
Takes care of business on his cellphone
It's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,
don't you dare touch me no more"
Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed
If you've gotta go, I won't stop you
You'll hear me singing you
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah... You've made it easy for the both of us"
If he's got a chest and some arms
He'll hear me singing you
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah... You've made it easy for the both of us"
Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed
If you've gotta go, I won't stop you
You'll hear me singing you
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah... You've made it easy for the both of us"
If he's got a chest and some arms
He'll hear me singing you
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah... You've made it easy for the both of us"
