Never say never
Never ever, never, never ever, never ever
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never
I will fight
I will fight 'til forever
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never
Ne-never say never
Ne-never say never
Never say it, never, never say it
I never thought I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny
I will never say never
I will fight
I will fight 'til forever
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, up, up, up
And never say never
Here we go, guess who?
J Smith and JB
I gotcha lil bro, I can handle him
Hold up, aight? I can handle him
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arm's a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill
They be trying to side with the thrill
No pun intended
Was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the Force
If push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the fourth
Ice water in blood
I gotta be the best, and yes we're the fliest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land
I will never say never
I will fight
I will fight 'til forever
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, up, up, up
And never say never
I will never say never
I will fight
I will fight 'til forever
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never
Never say it
Ne-never say never
Never say it
Ne-never say never
Never say it
And never say never
Ne-never say never
Never say it
Ne-never say never
Never say it
Ne-never say never
Never say it
And never say never
