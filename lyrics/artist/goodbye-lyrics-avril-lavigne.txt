Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye my love
I can't hide, can't hide, can't hide what has come
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know
Always know
Always know that I love you so
I love you so
I love you so, oh
Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye for now
Goodbye sunshine
Take care of yourself
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
And leave you alone
But always know
Always know
Always know that I love you so
I love you so, oh
I love you so, oh
La lullaby
Distract me with your eyes
La lullaby
La lullaby
Help me sleep tonight
La lullaby
(La lullaby, la lullaby)
I have to go (goodbye)
I have to go (lullaby)
I have to go (goodbye)
And leave you alone
But always know (goodbye)
Always know (brown eyes)
Always know (goodbye)
That I love you so
I love you so (goodbye lullaby)
I love you so, oh (goodbye)
I love you so (goodbye brown eyes)
I love you so (goodbye)
I love you so
I love you so
Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye my love I have to go goodbye
