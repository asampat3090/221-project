Come on, let's pop the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could, be here for the night
Man it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten up city lights
My whole team winning, no vision of quiting
I rather say I did than let them buzzards say I didn't
Let 'em talk about it mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try everyday to go and get it
[Pusha T]
Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Poppa don't preach, all we do is reach here
Raised round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doing they magic, voodoo moulin rouge
That's a tactic that they use, f-ck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
The boat comes, the dope drums, my team wins
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

Supreme Ballas, all my niggas got ESPY's
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Triple doubles, two hoes and cheque please
They love me on my Ric Flair shit
In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch
Who are you to be compared with?
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Court cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces
Yeah! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade

Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me
The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me
Yeah, the competition is all but died to me
Raah, I make these mothaf-ckas hide from me
The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
You just posing for them pics so you can upload
Yeah! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga
