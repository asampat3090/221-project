Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
I will climb a mountain high
Until our love will touch the sky
Baby come, get more close to me
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
I will climb a mountain high
Until our love will touch the sky
Baby come, get more close to me
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
Baby if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
