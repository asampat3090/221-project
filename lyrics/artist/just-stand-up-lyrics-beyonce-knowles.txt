Everything'll be alright again
Alright again, alright again
The heart is stronger than you think
Like it could go through anything
And even when you think it cant
It finds a way to still push on though
Sometimes you wanna to run away
Aint got the patience for the pain
And if you dont believe it look into your heart
The beat goes on
Im tellin you things get better through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, dont let up
Dont you know you can go be your own miracle
You need to know!
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up
Ooh, its like we all had better days
Problems getting all up in your face
Just because you go through it
Dont mean it gotta take control, no
You aint gotta find no hiding place
Because the heart can beat the hate
Dont wanna let the mind keep playing you
Saying you cant go on
Im tellin you things get better through whatever
If you fall, dust if off, dont let up
Dont you know you can go be your own miracle
You need to know!
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up
Through it all, just stand up
You dont gotta be a prisoner in your mind
If you fall, dust it off, you can live your life
Yeah, let your heart be your guide
Yeah yeah yeah
You will know there's a good if you trust the good
Everything will be alright, yeah
Light up the dark, if you follow your heart
And it will get better through whatever
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up
You got it in you, find it within
You got in now, find it within now
You got in you, find it within
You got in now, find it within now
You got in you, find it within
You got in now, find it within now
Find it within you, find it within
Through it all, just stand up
