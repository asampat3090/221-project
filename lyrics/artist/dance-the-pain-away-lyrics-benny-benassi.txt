I'll take my time
Let the tears fall down
From my face
Wash the pain away
We're all speeding
Lost in this race
And my heart's in a hearse
Can we put it in reverse, babe
Cause I can't even feel the drum and bass
It's drowned out by the beat my heart makes
I hear that song but something is wrong
My mind's a million miles away
Ohh, Everybody's going to the floor
Maybe I don't want to dance anymore
Don't want to dance anymore
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain away
Touch that dial
I'm changing the station
Cause I can't smile
Like everyone else
Play my sad song
In heavy rotation
I won't go out
I'm trying to save myself
I can't even feel the drum and bass
It's drowned out by the beat my heart makes
I hear that song but something is wrong
My mind's a million miles away
Ohh, Everybody's going to the floor
Maybe I don't want to dance anymore
Don't want to dance anymore
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
How can you dance the pain away
Oh dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain away
I can't dance tonight
Oh everybody's movin but I'm tired
I can't dance tonight
I try to keep it movin but I but I but I
I can't dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain away
I can't dance the pain
