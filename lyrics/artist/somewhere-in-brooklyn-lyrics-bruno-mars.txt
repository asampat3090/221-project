She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the crowd
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
Little Ms. Perfect sitting at the train stop
Red Nike high-tops listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting started conversating
Before I got her name along came a train
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Next stop Brooklyn
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Now I'm lookin'
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
On the street kickin' rocks circling the same block
Green Farm, Flatbush, checking every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders askin' if they know her
Everyday's the same back to the train
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Next stop Brooklyn
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm still lookin'
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere in Brooklyn
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I wonder we we'll ever meet again
Yeah, I wonder if we'll meet again
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn
