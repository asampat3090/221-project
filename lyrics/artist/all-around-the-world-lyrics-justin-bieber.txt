JB, Luda!
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itching for beauty, but you're scratchin' the surface
Lost time is never found, can the dj please reverse it
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work, if you workin with people saying you don't deserve it
Then don't give in, 'cuz hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you
It's only right that?
