I love you, I love you, I love you
Baby I love you, you are my life
The happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation and connection to the sun with you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome you are the raindrops
I am the seed with you and God, who's the sunlight
I'll bloom and grow so beautifully baby I'm so proud
Proud to be your girl you make the confusion
Go all away from this cold and messed up world
Coz I am in love with you you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
I am in love with you you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
And I know you love me love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am
Baby, you were my man I know it ain't easy
Easy loving me, I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me later on in my destiny
I see myself having your child, I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you
Sometimes makes me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
Every time I see your face my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good it hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love to hold to feel to breathe, to live you dangerously in love
Can't do this thing, yeah, I love you, I love you
I love you I'll never leave just keep loving me, oh no
'Cause I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you
I can not do, I can not do this thing, without you in my life
Holding me, kissing me, loving me
Dangerously, dangerously
Dangerous, dangerously in love, with you
Oh, I love you I love you, love you
Love you, love you love you, I love you
Oh yes, I love you I love you, love you
love you, love you, love with you
Love you I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you dangerously in love
