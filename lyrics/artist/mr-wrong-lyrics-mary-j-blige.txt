[Drake - Verse 1]
Don't it seem like, like I'm always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time, a terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working made me an addict
Theres way more people that want it than people that have it
I dont get it, I would hate to think I tricked 'em
They fall victim to my system, guess I sure know how to pick 'em
And I'm always her regret, yeah, I'm always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever's coming next
It goes up and down, it's just up and down
She's crying now but she'll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
In expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she's not the type to hold grudges
I'm wrong..
[Mary J Blige]
Bad boys aint no good
Good boys aint no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one
[Chorus]
Me and Mr Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr Mister Wrong
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Aint no way that I'm moving on
I love my Mr Wrong
Hung up off your good
You call and I run
My family's screaming at me don't do it
Dont do it Mary
I guess they never had none
[Chorus]
When he put that loving on me, I can't think of nothing
That'll make me walk out
I'm holding on
I love my Mr Wrong
He be kissing and touching on me
I can't help but love him
I must be out my mind
For going so strong
I love my Mr Wrong
[Chorus]
Me and Mr Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr Wrong, (mister wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Aint no way that I'm moving on
I love my Mr Wrong
