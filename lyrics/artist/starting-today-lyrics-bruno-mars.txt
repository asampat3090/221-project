We had a date, I stood you up
You tried to call but I didn't pick up
See I forgot about our plans..
Please forgive your man for ruining your night so many times
I'm sorry, I know you're mad
And I don't wanna be like every other man that you've had
So I'm stopping all these childish games, girl, you mean too much to me
Your love is worth too much to lose
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard
But watch how quick I change my ways.. starting today, starting today
I know that I'm the one to blame, you say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways.. starting today, starting today
Girl, I'm starting today..
You're tired of playing the kiss and make up game
And I apologize for the man I became
If I could do it all again, I wouldn't hurt my best friend
And I'd throw away all my selfish ways
I'm sorry, I know you're mad
And I don't wanna be like every other man that you've had
So I'm stopping all these childish games, girl, you mean too much to me
Your love is worth too much to lose
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard
But watch how quick I change my ways.. starting today, starting today
I know that I'm the one to blame, you say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways.. starting today, starting today
Girl, I'm starting today..
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard
But watch how quick I change my ways.. starting today, starting today
I know that I'm the one to blame, you say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways.. starting today, starting today
Girl, I'm starting today..
