Uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, oh!
Uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, oh!
Check it out, goin' out on the late night
Lookin tight, feelin nice, it's a cock fight
I can tell, I just know that it's goin' down tonight
At the door we don't wait cause we know them
At the bar, six shots, just beginnin
That's when dickhead put his hands on me, but you see
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just u + ur hand tonight
Uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, oh!
Uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, oh!
Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
Wanna dance by myself, guess you're outta luck
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one, uh buh-bye!
Listen up it's just not happenin
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
Just let me have my fun tonight, aight?
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just u + ur hand tonight
Uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, oh!
Uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, oh!
(Break break break, break it, break it down)
Youre in the corner with your boys, you bet em five bucks
Youd get the girl that just walked in but she thinks you suck
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
So quit spillin your drinks on me, yeah
You know who you are
High-fivin, talkin shit
But you're going home alone, arent ya?
Cause I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just u + ur hand tonight
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just u + ur hand tonight
