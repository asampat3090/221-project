We say goodbye, I turn my back
Run away, run away, so predictable
Not far from here, you see me crack
Like a bone, like a bone, I'm so breakable
I'll take everything from you
But you'll take anything, won't you?
Run away, run away like a prodigal
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me
So ashamed, so ashamed but I need you so
And you wait for me, and you wait for me
I'm on the road to who knows where
Look ahead, not behind I keep saying
There's no place to go where you're not there
On your rope I hold tight but it's freeing
I'll take everything from you
But you'll take anything, won't you?
Run away, run away like a prodigal
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me
So ashamed, so ashamed but I need you so
And you wait for me, and you wait for me
Everybody wants to be right
But only if it's not a day light
I keep trying to find my way back
My way back
Run away, run away like a prodigal
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me
So ashamed, so ashamed but I need you so
And you wait for me, and you wait for me
Runaway, runaway, runaway
From you, from you, from you
