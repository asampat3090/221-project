I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
And I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
'Cause all this bullshit just make me strong, motherfucker
So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah, bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah, and I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent and you're hell-proof
I, I'll walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is the stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside
So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah, bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah, and I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream fuck 'em all
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in
Up, it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin'
Boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game ain't
Gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe that
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die
My head is swolle', my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal, I'm unstoppable, incredible hulk,
you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast
Your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'
So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah, bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah, and I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
