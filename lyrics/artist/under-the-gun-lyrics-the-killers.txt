The%20Killers
rock
She's got her halo and wings
Hidden under his eyes
But she's an angel for sure
She just can't stop telling lies
But it's too late for his love
Already caught in a trap
His angel's kiss was a joke
And she is not coming back
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free and then he says to me
Kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
Yeah, she's got a criminal mind
He's got a reason to pray
His life is under the gun
He's got to hold every day
Now he just wants to wake up
Yeah, just to prove it's a dream
'Cause she's an angel for sure
But that remains to be seen
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free and then he says to me
Kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
Stupid on the streets of London
James Dean in the rain
Without her it's not the same
But it's alright
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free and then he says to me
Kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now again and again
