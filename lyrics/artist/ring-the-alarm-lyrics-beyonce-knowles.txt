Ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Tell me how should I feel when I know what I know
And my female intuition tellin' me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations what you mean you gon' choke
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spendin' your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Tell me how should I feel when you made me belong
And the thought of you just touchin' her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
He's so arrogant and bold
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma 'cause
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Ooh, how can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you
Ooh, why would you risk it babe
Is that the price that I pay, ooh
But this is my show, and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
