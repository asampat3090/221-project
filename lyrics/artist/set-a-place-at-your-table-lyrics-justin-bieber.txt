Things seemed strange this morning
As I packed my bag for school
The smiles I'm used to seeing just weren't there
I heard my father talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that I could hear... was
Chorus:
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
There's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and i
i was feeling kinda helpless
About the words that I just heard
Could it be the family 2 doors down?
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up against the wall
And though it may seem small
i know there's something i can do
Chorus
Make room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day and just laugh talk and eat
Chorus
.there's a little hope for you and I
