pop
I have seen the rain
I have felt the pain
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
I don't know where I'm going
I don't even know
Where I've been
But I know
I'd like to see them again
Spend my days just searching
Spend my nights in dreams
Stop looking over my shoulder baby
I stopped wondering what it means
Drop out, burn out, sold your home
Oh, they said I should've been more
Probably so if I hadn't have been
In that crazy damn Vietnam war
I have seen the rain
I've survived the pain
Oh, I've been home 30 years or so
And I'm just stepping off of the plane
Spend my days just searching
Spend my nights in dreams
Stop looking over my shoulder baby
I stopped wondering what it means
Drop out, burn out, sold your home
Oh, they said I should've been more
Probably so if I hadn't have been
In that crazy damn Vietnam war
We have seen the rain together
We survived the pain forever
Oh, it's good to be home again
It's good to be with my friends
Oh, it's good to be home again
It's good to feel that rain
