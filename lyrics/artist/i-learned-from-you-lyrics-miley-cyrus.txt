Sometimes I couldn't hear what you're trying to tell me
I thought that I knew all I need to know
I didn't understand that the doors you would open
Could take me somewhere I wanted to go
I can be strong for you now
You taught me how
I learned from you that I do not crumble
I learned that strength is somethin' you choose
All of the reasons to keep on believin'
There's no question, that's a lesson, I learned from you
You know where to find all of my hiding places
And there are no secrets from you I can keep
You let me know how you feel, pulling no punches
And I never knew that kind of honesty
I'm grateful for all of the times
You opened my eyes
I learned from you that I do not crumble
I learned that strength is somethin' you choose
All of the reasons to keep on believin'
There's no question, that's a lesson, I learned from you
You helped me to stand on my own
And I thank you for that
It saved me, it made me
And now that I'm looking back I can say
I learned from you that I do not crumble
I learned that strength is somethin' you choose
All of the reasons to keep on believin'
There's no question, that's a lesson, I learned from you
I do not crumble
I learned that strength is somethin' you choose
All of the reasons to keep on believin'
There's no question, that's a lesson, I learned from you
I learned from you
