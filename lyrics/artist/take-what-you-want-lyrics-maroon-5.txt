I woke up this morning with the burden of love hanging over my head as I
Walked into the living room
Sit with you, discuss whats going on
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something I forgot to do?
Tell me so that I understand
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me, given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me
I woke up this morning with the hurting that I would never ever wish upon
Even my worst enemy
Who is she, what the hell do you people want?
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it something i forgot to do?
Tell me so that i understand
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me anyway
I just need some time
Gather all my thoughts
To make up for the love I just lost
You've been so good to me given me everything
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me
