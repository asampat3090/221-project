If you hear this message, wherever you stand
I'm calling every woman, calling every man
We're the generation, we can't afford to wait
The future started yesterday and we're already late
We've been looking for a song to sing
Searched for a melody, searched for someone to lead
We've been looking for the world to change
If you feel the same then go on and say
If you're out there, sing along with me
If you're out there, I'm dying to believe
That you're out there, stand up and say it loud
If you're out there, tomorrow's starting now, now, now
No more broken promises, no more call to war
Unless it's love and peace that we're really fighting for
We can destroy hunger, we can conquer hate
Put down the arms and raise your voice
We're joining hands today
Oh, I, I was looking for a song to sing
Searched for a leader but the leader was me
We were looking for the world to change
We can be heroes just go on and say
If you're out there, sing along with me
If you're out there, I'm dying to believe
That you're out there, stand up and say it loud
If you're out there, tomorrow's starting now, now, now
Oh, now, now, now
If you're ready, we can shake the world
Believe again, it starts within
We don't have to wait for destiny
We should be the change that we want to see
If you're out there, oh
If you're out there and you're ready now
Say it loud, scream it out
If you're out there, sing along with me
If you're out there, I'm dying to believe
That you're out there, stand up and say it loud
If you're out there, tomorrow's starting now
If you're out there
If you're out there
If you're out there
If you hear this message, wherever you stand
Calling every woman, calling every man
We're the generation, and we can't afford to wait
The future started yesterday and we're already late
