rock
Candy talks to strangers
Thinks her life's in danger
No one gives a damn about her hair
It's lonely down on track street
She used to go by Jackie
The cops, they'll steal your dreams
And they'll kill your prayers
Take a number where the blood just barely dried
Wait for something better
No one behind you, watching your shadows
This feeling won't go
Crooked wheels keep turnin'
Children, are you learnin'?
Climatize but don't you lose the plot
A history of blisters
Your brothers and your sisters
Somewhere in the pages we forgot
Take a number, Jackie
Where the blood just barely dried
You know I'm on your side
Wait for something better
No one behind you
Watching your shadows
You gotta be stronger than the stories
Don't let it blind you
Rivers of shadow
This feeling won't go
And the sky is full of dreams
But you don't know how to fly
I don't have a simple answer
But I know that I could answer something better
This feeling won't go
Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it
Something better
