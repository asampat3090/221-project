Midnight at the glamor show on Sunday night
Everybody drink a lotta whiskey and wine
We dance like no tomorrow, we're on burlesque time
But everybody's gotta work tomorrow at nine
Touch me, t-t-touch me, baby
But don't mess up my hair
Love me, l-love me crazy
But don't get too attached, this is a brief affair
Vanity
(Pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity
(There is a camera, so many beauty queens)
Vanity
(It's so good to be)
Fabulous and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else
Vanity, va-va-vanity, vanity
Nothin' wrong with being just a little bit vain
We need a little pretty 'cause this country's insane
So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothings quite as sexy as a woman is fine
Touch me, t-touch me, baby but don't mess up my hair
Love me, love me crazy
But don't get too attached, this is a brief affair

I'm comin' around, I'm sippin' on Andre, it's time [unverified]
I heard that you did the back star [unverified] in the party line
Let's dance
(Quick round)
We're in the vanity house
We're covered in sequins diamonds [unverified]
Touch me, touch me, baby but don't mess up my hair
Love me, love me crazy
But don't get too attached, this is a brink affair
