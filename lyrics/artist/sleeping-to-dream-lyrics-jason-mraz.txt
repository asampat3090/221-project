I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town
I'm counting my sheep and each one that passes is another dream to ashes
And they all fall down
And as I lay me down tonight
I close my eyes, what a beautiful sight
Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so tired of having to live without you
But I don't mind
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so damn tired
I found myself in the riches (Your eyes, your lips, your hair.) And you were everywhere
I woke up in the ditches. I hit the light and I thought you might be here
But you were nowhere. (You were nowhere)
Well, you were nowhere at home
As I lay me back to sleep
Lord I pray that I can keep
Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so tired of having to live without you
Well, I don't mind
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so damn tired
Just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at night
Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so tired of having to live without you
Well, I don't mind
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired
