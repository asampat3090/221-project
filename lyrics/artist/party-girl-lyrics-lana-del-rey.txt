pop
Standing on the rooftop, just out of earshot,
Looking at this gansgter guy,
Thinking he's a hot shot, pouring me a big shot,
Trying to get me drunk and high.
He wishes to be seen with me in his limosouine,
And he says we'll have a real good time,
Well, XXO,
But I want you to know...
Every single night,
In the lights I'll be sparkling bright,
I'm just a party girl trying to get my drinks for free from you,
If you hold me tight, it's alright,
Let the fire ignite,
I'm a party girl and I'm just warning you.
You don't get it, you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it,
Came tonight to put my work on display, bringing New York down to St. Tropez,
You don't get it, you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it,
(One) I won't fall in love,
(Two) I won't ever stop,
(Three) I'm partying all night,
(Four) I'm gonna make it pop.
Kissing on your white yacht,
Show me what you got-got,
Play your little rock 'n' roll,
I'm the island hot spot,
Maybe we shot dot, dot, dot...
Lose control..
Do you think it's really mean that I'm only on the scene 'cause I want a little danger, boy?
Well, XXO,
But I told you so...
Every single night,
In the lights I'll be sparkling bright,
I'm just a party girl trying to get my drinks for free from you,
If you hold me tight, it's alright,
Let the fire ignite,
I'm a party girl and I'm just warning you.
You don't get it, you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it,
Came tonight to put my work on display, bringing New York down to St. Tropez,
You don't get it, you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it,
(One) I won't fall in love,
(Two) I won't ever stop,
(Three) I'm partying all night,
(Four) I'm gonna make it pop.
Well, it's not about us,
Just forget about us tonight,
Put your cigarette down, baby,
Light up the town beside me.
You don't get it, you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it,
You don't get it, you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it,
Came tonight to put my work on display, bringing New York down to St. Tropez,
You don't get it, you just don't get it,
You've already forgotten even though I just said it,
(One) I won't fall in love,
(Two) I won't ever stop,
(Three) I'm partying all night,
(Four) I'm gonna make it pop.
