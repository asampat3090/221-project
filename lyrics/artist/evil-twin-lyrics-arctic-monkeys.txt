rock
You've never met before
But still she greets you like a long lost rock and roll
She's definitely one of those
But you'll go wherever she goes
Oh when my body and my mind
Both start talking at the exact same time
Try'na think of ways to make her mine
But they're difficult to find
It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me
And she said: "Oh, well I know this will sound cold
But I really have to go
Oh it's not that I'm not free
There's nowhere I need to be
It's just your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me"
It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me
She said: Baby, how can I believe you?
How can I believe you when you can't believe your luck?
No point sticking to the plan when it's going slow
It's more a hunger than a thirst
She'll break your heart the second time
Before you know about the first
Looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch
But you'll let her do your worst
And it's not hard to tell
It's obvious the other angels faces fell
When she told them that she had to go
Swap her wings and overcoat for something colorful
It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me
(No, your love's not what I need)
So don't give it to me
(No, your love's not what I need)
So don't give it to me
(No, your love's not what I need)
So don't give it to me
Your love's not what I need
