Ran into you yesterday
Memories rushed through my brain
It's starting to hit me, now you're not with me
I realized I made a mistake
I thought that I needed some space
But I just let love go to waste
It's so crystal clear now that I need you here now
I got to get you back today
This time I want it all, this time I want it all
Showing you all the cards, giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance, this time I'll be your man
I can be all you need, this time it's all of me
I hit the bar every night
Looking to score a good time
It's not like I planned it, we left empty handed
'Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight?
Is there someone new now, what can I do now?
'Cause I need you back by my side
This time I want it all, this time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards, giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance, this time I'll be your man
I can be all you need, this time is all of me
Last time I wasn't sure, this time I will give you more
I'm more mature, I'll show you
Last time I didn't know, I messed up and let you go
I need you, don't say no
Lying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Pick up the phone
Won't you come home?
This time I want it all, this time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards, giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance, this time I'll be your man
I can be all you need, this time is all of me, all of me, yeah
