Coldplay
rock
When it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line, my back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in daylight
There we were dying of frustration
Saying, "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Since they've gone
If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop, then they let it go
If there's any screaming let the windows down
As I crawl to the ground
If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness
