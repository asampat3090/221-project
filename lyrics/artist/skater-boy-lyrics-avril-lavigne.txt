pop
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it anymore obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends, stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy, she said, "See ya later boy"
He wasn't good enough for her, she had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees
Skater boy rocking up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy, she said "See ya later boy"
He wasn't good enough for her, now he's a superstar
Slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
Sorry girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it anymore obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each others world?
I'm with the skater boy, I said "See ya later boy"
I'll be backstage after the show, I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know
