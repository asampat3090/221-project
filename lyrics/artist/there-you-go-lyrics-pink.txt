Please don't come around
Talkin' bout that you love me
Cause that love shit just ain't for me
I don't wanna hear that you adore me
And I know that all you're doing is running your mind games
Don't you know that game's began
So your best bet is to be straight with me
So you say you wanna talk, let's talk
If you won't talk I'll walk, yeah it's like that
Got a new man, he's waiting out back
Now what! Whatcha' think about that
Now when I say I'm through I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say
Had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay
There u go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There u go, talkin' bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There u go, talkin' bout you miss me so
That you love me so
Why I let you go
Yeah you know cause your lies got old
Look at you, there u go
Please don't come around talkin' bout how you changed
How you said goodbye to what's her name
All it sounds like to me is new game
And I was right
When I thought I'd be much better off without you
Had to get myself from round you
Cause my life was all about you
So you say you wanna talk, I don't
Say you wanna change, I won't
Yeah it's like that
Had your chance, won't take you back
Now what! Whatcha' think about that
When I say I'm through, I'm through
Basically I'm through with you
Whatcha' wanna say
Had to have it your way, had to play games
Now you're begging me to stay
There u go, lookin' pitiful
Just because I let you go
There u go, talkin' bout you want me back
But sometimes it be's like that, so
There u go, talkin' bout you miss me so
That you love me so
Why I let you go
Yeah you know cause your lies got old
Look at you, there u go
Oooh, don't you wish you could turn the hands of time
Don't you wish that you still were mine
Don't you wish I'd take you back
Don't you wish that things were simple like that
Didn't miss a good thing til' it's gone
But I knew it wouldn't be long
Til' you came running back, missing my love
There you go
