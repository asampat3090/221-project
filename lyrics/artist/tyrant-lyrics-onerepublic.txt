Watching myself when Im taking strides
But here comes the moon and it feels
And it feels like an informer, quick run away hide
Before they see you, you know it is all, all a glow
Walking on water seems parlays now
You got my trust and it feels
And it feels like sabotage when Im pulling triggers back
On myself you know it is all I know, is all I know
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out, from the out
Tyrant, tyrant
Feel capable of most anything
This crippled bears gonna sing, gonna bring you
All the years is quick turn around, look your shadows could
Could not beautiful lies for you is what they do
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out, from the out
From the out, from the out tyrant
Ill stay with apathy I'm blind but I can see
The tyrant to the bone
Ill stay with apathy I'm blind but I can see
Dont justify me, dont justify me, dont justify me
Dont justify me, dont justify, dont justify me
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out, from the out
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out, from the out, from the out
Tyrant, tyrant
