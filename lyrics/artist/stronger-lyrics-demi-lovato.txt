The night is getting darker
Soon the stars will be falling down to rescue us,
Sing a song for me,
Lift me higher with your words,
Sing that cold melody.
So follow me
Onto the moonlit sidewalk
And take my hand
Grip it tighter, and don't let it go
Passions taking over skies
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on
And they'll try to speak
Negatively about us,
But they can't say another word
But they'll realize,
Jealousy has taken over their minds
And the words they try
to bring me down with
they all make, us stronger
Did you feel that breeze?
A tide of chills just swept over me
It must of been from the brush of your hand
Pull me into your arms
A little closer baby
I wanna see you standing
Next to me
So take a walk with me,
But keep the pace down
I don't want this night to end
Can't we runaway together?
Passions taking over skies
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on
And they'll try to speak
Negatively about us,
But they can't say another word
Passions taking over skies
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on
And they'll try to speak
Negatively about us,
But they can't say another word
But they'll realize,
Jealousy has taken over their minds
And the words they try
to bring me down with
they all made, us stronger
The night is getting darker
And soon the stars will be falling down to rescue us.
