It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young
We're all born superstars
She rolled my hair, put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby, I was born this way
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be, don't be, don't be
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby, I was born this way
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, Chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause, baby, you were born this way
No matter gay, straight or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
