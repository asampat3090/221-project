Maroon%205
rock
Danced all night and slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don't cry and you don't care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?
Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck, living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
Wither on a sunny day
Time slows down, I wish you'd stay
Pass me by in crowded dark hallways
Try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink
Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck, living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
I heard you say you needed me
Now what's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart
Take what you want
And I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?
Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart
I heard you say you needed me
Now what's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart
