rock
You build me up, you knock me down
Provoke a smile and make me frown
You are the queen of run around
You know it's true
You chew me up and spit me out
Enjoy the taste, I leave in your mouth
You look at me, I look at you
Neither of us know what to do
And there may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin
Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true but I believe 'em anyway
So come to bed it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin
You feel your heart begin to race
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin, yeah
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin, yeah
