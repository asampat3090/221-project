[LIAM]
I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm she came around
She was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry
You couldn't be that girl I adored
You don't seem to know or seem to care
What your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore
[HARRY]
There's nothing left, I used to cry
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine
[HARRY, LOUIS, NIALL]
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn (I'm already torn)
[HARRY]
There's nothing left, I used to cry
Inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine
[HARRY, LOUIS, NIALL]
I'm torn
Torn
I'm torn
[HARRY]
Nothing's fine
I'm torn
[ALL]
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying broken on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn
[ZAYN]
I'm already
I'm already torn
[ALL]
Torn
Oooh
Torn
