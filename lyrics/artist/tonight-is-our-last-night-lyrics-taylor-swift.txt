The lies are always better left unsaid
So take the photos down of the wall
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a plane and I want out
From all these stories that people tell
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Now you know exactly how I feel
The truth is out and I can see what's real
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a scene and I want out
From all these stories that people tell
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night alone dear
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
