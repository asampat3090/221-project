Money ain't nothin but money when you get to the money, ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love, when you learn to love, ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party when you party everyday, ain't nothing but a party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
We want love, money, party
If I can't trust then why am I giving my heart
In exchange for him to love me
Cause there ain't much difference
In a one night stand then one that ain't for me
Giving too much cause you hate that you love
Everything that he do and you can't deny you want him
So what, light a fire underneath this bitch and blow
Money ain't nothing, money can't buy you love
I don't give a damn if he's sitting on a crib
Money ain't nothing, what about the real and the way you build
Money get low and the DJ stop and the music slow down and the shit gets blurry
Money ain't nothing but money
When you get to the money, it ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love, when you learn how to love, ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party when you party everyday, ain't nothing but a party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
We want love, money, party
I've been through heartbreaks, heartbreaks
Much for anybody with a human heart to take
You know it's something that you care to elaborate
But I've been left with the live bait
I done messed with the fire, I met a girl on the side
I done leave it all on the line
Money ain't nothing, money can't buy you love
I don't give a damn if he's sitting on a crib
Money ain't nothing, what about the real and the way you build
Money get low and the DJ stop and the music slow down and the shit gets blurry
Love, Money, Party, yeah
Money ain't nothing but money
When you get to the money, ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love, when you learn how to love, it ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party when you party everyday, ain't nothing but a party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
We want love, money, party
[Big Sean:]
Okay, I walk in, sorta late
My girl and watch both coordinate
They both got that Gordon space
They both shine, they both mine
Getting green cause it's go time
God damn, I'm so fine
All the guys 'oh super model type girls'
Yeah, I'm chilling with those kind
B.I.G. Sean don, whine Perion
Detroit, player boy, get my berry on
On an all night flight to an island
I'll be gone in the morning
I don't even need a carry on
What, this that all night, get dressed up shit
Red cup, get messed up shit
Me and Miley, it's just us bitch
[Miley:]
Money ain't nothing but money
When you get to the money, ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love, when you learn to love, ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party when you party everyday, ain't nothing but a party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
Love, money, party, love, money, party
We want love, money, party
