Hey, Orpheus!
I'm behind you
Don't turn around
I can find you
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
And if I call for you
Oh, Orpheus!
Just sing for me all night
We'll wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
You say it's not me, it's you
Hey, Orpheus!
De l'autre côté de l'eau
Comme un écho
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
And if I shout for you
Never doubt
Don't turn around too soon
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
It seems so important now
But you will get over
It seems so important now
But you will get over
And when you get over
When you get older
Then you will remember
Why it was so important then
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
When you get over
And when you get older
Then you will discover
That it's never over
Hey, Eurydice!
Can you see me?
I will sing your name
Till you're sick of me
Just wait until it's over
Just wait until it's through
But if you call for me
This frozen sea
It melts beneath me
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
And when you get over
And when you get older
Then you will remember
He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
Now that it's over
Now that you're older
Then you will discover
That it's never over
It's never over (it's never over) [8x]
Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow
Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow
Cause it's never over
It's never over (it's never over) [6x]
We stood beside
A frozen sea
I saw you out
In front of me
Reflected light
A hollow moon
Oh Orphes, Eurydice
Its over too soon
