Do you want me on your mind?
Or do you want me to go home?
It might be yours
Is as sure as I can say
But can't be far away
Oooooh
Oooooh
Roses on parade
They follow you around
Upon your shore
Is as sure as I can say
But can't be far away
Oooooh
Oooooh
Like fuel to fire
To the town we'll go
And to your hideaway
Where the towers grow
Gone to be far away
Sit quietly
Alone.
Eyes want to cry
And do
They undo?
Upon your shore
Then as sure as I can say
But can't be far away
Oh, what a day
To choose
Torn by our world
All that is safe
To you
Is like fuel to the fire
To the town we'll go
And to your hideaway
Where the towers grow
Gone to be far away
Never do we know
Never do they give away
Where the towers grow
Only you will lead us there
Sit quietly
Alone
Sit quietly
Alone.
