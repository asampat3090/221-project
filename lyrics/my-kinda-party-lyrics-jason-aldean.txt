[Verse 1:]
I worked all week.
Cleaned up, clean cut, and clean shaved.
I got the cover off the '68.
I fired it up, and let them horses sing.
A little pretty thing.
A little tan legged Georgia dream.
She's a'rockin' them holey jeans.
Baby, what you got goin' on Saturday? You know,
Words got it, there's gonna be a party,
Out of town about half a mile.
Four wheel drives and big mud tires.
Muscadine wine
[Chorus]
Oh baby, you can find me.
In the back of a jacked up tailgate.
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things.
a'Get down in that Georgia clay.
And I'll find peace.
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink.
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank.
Lets get this thing started.
It's my kind of party.
Well if you wanna drink.
Go on baby, just do your thing.
But give up your keys.
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we'll sneak away from the bonfire.
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside.
Gotcha sippin' on the moonshine.
Baby, if you're in mood and you can settle for a one night rodeo.
If you can be my tan-legged Juliet,
I'll be your Redneck Romeo.
Oh baby, you can find me.
In the back of a jacked up tailgate.
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things.
a'Get down in that Georgia clay.
And I'll find peace.
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink.
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank.
Lets get this thing started.
It's my kind of party.
Oh baby, you can find me.
In the back of a jacked up tailgate.
Sittin' 'round watchin' all these pretty things.
a'Get down in that Georgia clay.
And I'll find peace.
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink.
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank.
Lets get this thing started.
It's my kind of party.
Haha, y'all ready for this?
Y'all go head and turn it on up.
