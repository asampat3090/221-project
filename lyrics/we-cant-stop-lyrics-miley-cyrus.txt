Its our party we can do what we want (no drama)
Its our party we can say what we want (Mike will made)
Its our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can live how we want
Its our party we can do what we want
Its our party we can say what we want
Its our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can live how we want
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
Cause we came to have so much fun now
Got somebody here might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "Hell, no!"? (Hell no)
Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight alright
So la da di da di
we like to party
Dancing with Molly
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules
And we can't stop
And we wont stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it we who bout that life
And we can't stop
And we wont stop
We run things, Things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody
Its our party we can do what we want
Its our party we can say what we want
Its our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can see who we want
To my home girls here with the big butts
Shaking it like we at a strip club
Remember only God can judge us
Forget the haters cause somebody loves ya
And everyone in line in the bathroom
Trying to get a line in the bathroom
We all so turned up here
Getting turned up yea yea
So la da da di
we like to party
Dancing with Molly
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules
And we can't stop
And we wont stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
And we can't stop
And we wont stop
We run things
Things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody
Its our party we can do what we want
Its our party we can say what we want
Its our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can see who we want
Its our party we can do what we want to
Its our house we can love who we want to
