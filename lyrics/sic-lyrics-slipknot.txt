Slipknot
metal
Here comes the pain
Enemy, show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything
Even if I can't handle you
Readily, either way it better be
Don't you fucking pity me
Get up, get off
What the hell am I saying?
I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent
I want somebody to step up, step off
Walls, let me fall
Fuck you all
Get a grip, don't let me slip
'Til I drop the ball
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're going down, this is a war
Fuck
Who the fuck am I to criticize
Your twisted state of mind
You're leaving me suspect
I'm leaving you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect, you jealous ass
Press your face against the glass, suffer
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're going down, this is a war
I've just begun
It's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time, gotta get mine
You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you
Sic, sic, sic, sic
