Well call me crazy, call me lazy
Maybe you can even call me ignorant
Here's a tissue for the issue
I don't care if it's on CNN
I've got a lot to deal with
I rather just be chillin'
It's how I'm feeling
Maybe I can worry about it all tomorrow
I just want today
Wo-oh, call me your fool
'Cause sometimes I just don't care
I don't right now
We all gotta do it, do it
'Cause life can be a b*tch then we die, we die
There's so much sh*t to worry about
And that's the reason why
It's why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
Like wow, wow
