Ciara
pop
1, 2, 3, go
Ciara, sex, Ciara, talk to 'em
Your touch is so magic to me
The strangest things can happen
The way that you react to me
I wanna do something you can't imagine
Imagine if there was a million me's
Talkin' sexy to you like that
You think you can handle, boy
If I give you my squeeze
And I need you to push it right back
Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' till clothing disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh baby
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
Everythin' ain't what it seems
I wave my hands and I got you
And you feel so fly assistin' me
But now it's my turn to watch you
I ain't goin stop you if you wanna grab my neck
Talk sexy to me like that
Just do what I taught you, girl
When I give you my heat
And I need you to push it right back
Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' till clothing disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh baby
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
Oh, this is the part where we fall in love, sugar
Let's slow it down so we fall in love
But don't stop what you're doing to me
Ciara
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
Yeah, I see you on the floor, get it, girl
Love, sex and magic
I see you on the floor
You know what I mean
Get it, girl
I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
I see you on the floor, get it, girl
