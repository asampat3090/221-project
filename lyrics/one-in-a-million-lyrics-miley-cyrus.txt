How did I get here? I turned around and there you were
I didn't think twice or rationalize
'Cause somehow I knew
That there was more that just chemistry
I mean I knew you were kind of into me
But I figured it's too good to be true
I said, Pinch me, where's the catch this time?"
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get used to this guy
They say that good things take time
But really great things happen
In the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody
Like you were a million to one
I cannot believe it, you're one in a million
All this time I was looking for love
Tryna make things work that weren't good enough
Till I thought I'm through, said, I'm done
And stumbled into the arms of the one
You're making me laugh about the silliest stuff
Say that I'm your diamond in the rough
When I'm mad at you, you come with your velvet touch
Can't believe that I'm so lucky
I have never felt so happy
Every time I see that sparkle in your eyes
They say that good things take time
But really great things happen
In the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody
Like you were a million to one
I cannot believe it, you're one in a million
All this time I was looking for love
Tryna make things work that weren't good enough
Till I thought I'm through, said, I'm done
And stumbled into the arms of the one
I said, Pinch me, where's the catch this time?"
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get used to this guy
They say that good things take time
But really great things happen
In the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody
Like you were a million to one
I cannot believe it, yeah yeah
They say that good things take time
But really great things happen
In the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody
Like you were a million to one
I cannot believe it, you're one in a million, yeah
One in a million, yeah
You're one in a million
