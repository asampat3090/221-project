Don't get me wrong, I love who I am
I don't want to be ungrateful, it probably sounds strange
I really love the role I play
The songs I sing, but with all the fame
The things that seem so simple
Are suddenly so far out of reach
Wish that they could see that underneath
I'm just an ordinary girl
Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything could happen in this world
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
How are you? Hello, goodbye
One day here, one day there, and again it's time to go
Ms. Popular, always on the roll
Put my best foot forward, gotta get on with the show
Strike a pose for the front cover of a magazine
Everywhere I arrive, I get high-fives
They pay me larger than life [YEAH!]
I'm just an ordinary girl
Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything could happen in this world
For an ordinary girl
So give it everything
Or nothing at all
Get back on your feet
When you stumble and fall
A little luck can go a long way
So don't you worry 'bout what people say
Who knows where the wind may blow
For an ordinary girl [Mmmm]
I'm just an ordinary girl
Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored [Yeah!]
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything could happen in this world
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
For an ordinary girl
For an ordinary girl
Like me, like you
