Oh Oh Oh I was a city boy.
Right into danger's where I'd always run
A boy who had his fun
But I wouldn't have done all the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now baby, now baby, now baby
Oh oh I, I know it breaks your heart
To picture the only one you wanna love
In someone else's arms
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Naw baby, naw baby, naw baby
Oh baby please let's leave the past behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
It will find us
I know most girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me
Baby I...I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
No I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
If I knew one day you'd come
