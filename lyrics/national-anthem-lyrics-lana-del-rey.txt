Money is the anthem
Of success
So before we go out
What's your address?
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em,
Reckless abandon,
Holdin' me for ransom,
Upper echelon.
He says to "be cool" but,
I don't know how yet.
Wind in my hair,
Hand on the back of my neck.
I said, "Can we party later on?"
He said, "Yes, yes." (Yes.)
Tell me I'm your National Anthem.
(Ooh, yeah, baby, bow down,)
(Making me so wow, wow.)
Tell me I'm your National Anthem.
(Sugar, sugar, how now,)
(Take your body down town.)
Red, white, blue's in the sky,
Summer's in the air and baby,
Heaven's in your eyes.
I'm your National Anthem.
Money is the reason,
We exist.
Everybody knows it,
It's a fact. Kiss, kiss.
I sing the National Anthem,
While I'm standing,
Over your body,
Hold you like a python.
And you can't keep your hands off.
Me, or your pants on.
See what you've done to me?
Give me Chevron.
You said to "be cool" but,
I'm already coolest.
I said to "get real",
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me,
Lots of diamonds? (Yes, I also brought my gun)
Tell me I'm your National Anthem.
(Ooh, yeah, baby, bow down,)
(Making me so wow, wow.)
Tell me I'm your National Anthem.
(Sugar, sugar, how now,)
(Take your body down town.)
Red, white, blue's in the skies,
Summer's in the air and baby,
Heaven's in your eyes.
I'm your National Anthem.
It's a love story for the new age,
For the six page,
Want a quick, sick rampage?
Wining and dining, drinking and driving,
Excessive buying, overdosin', dyin',
On our drugs and our love,
And our dreams and our rage.
Blurring the lines,
Between real and the fake.
Dark and lonely,
I need somebody to hold me.
We will do very well,
I can tell, I can tell,
Keep my safe in his bell,
Tower, hotel.
Money is the anthem,
Of success.
So put on mascara,
And your party dress.
I'm your National Anthem,
Boy, put your hands up,
Give me a standing ovation.
Boy, you have landed,
Babe, in the land of,
Sweetness and danger,
Queen of Saigon.
Tell me I'm your National Anthem.
(Ooh, yeah, baby, bow down,)
(Making me so wow, wow.)
Tell me I'm your National Anthem.
(Sugar, sugar, how now,)
(Take your body down town.)
Red, white, blue's in the skies,
Summer's in the air and baby,
Heaven's in your eyes.
I'm your National Anthem.
Money is the anthem,
God, you're so handsome.
Money is the anthem,
Of success
Money is the anthem,
God, you're so handsome.
Money is the anthem,
Of success
Money is the anthem,
God, you're so handsome.
Money is the anthem,
Of success
Money is the anthem,
God, you're so handsome.
Money is the anthem,
Of success
