This is the end station
But I cant move away from you
This is the edge of patience
But you won't prove yourself to me
Still you drain my soul and
Even though it hurts I cant slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Even though it hurts I cant slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Just one last time
Just one last time
Just one last time
There comes a time for us to part,
Then right back to the start.
And I know what Im supposed to do
Can't get myself away from you
Oh you drain my soul and
Even though it hurts I cant slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Even though it hurts I cant slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Just one last time
Just one last time
Just one last time
This is the end station
But I cant move away from you
