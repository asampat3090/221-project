Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer
Let's fly (fly,fly,fly,fly)
Up, up here we go, go
Up, up here we go, go
Let's fly (fly,fly,fly,fly)
Up, up here we go, go
Where we stop nobody knows
[Prohgress:]
Where we go, we don't need roads
And where we stop nobody knows
To the stars if you really want it
Got a jetpack with your name on it
Above the clouds and the atmosphere
Say the words and we outta here
Hold my hand if you feeling scared
We're flying up, up outta here
Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer
Let's fly (fly,fly,fly,fly)
Up, up here we go, go
Up, up here we go, go
Let's fly (fly,fly,fly,fly)
Up, up here we go, go
Where we stop nobody knows
[Kev Nish:]
Baby, we can stay fly like a G6
Shop the streets of Tokyo, get you fly kicks
Girl, your always on my mind
Got my head up in the sky
And I'm never looking down, feeling priceless
Yeah, where we at? only few have known
Were on some next level, super Mario
I hope this works out, cardio
Until then let's fly

Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer
Let's fly
[J-Splif:]
Yo, now I ain't ever been to space before
But I ain't never seen a face like yours
You make me feel like I can touch the planets
You want the moon girl, watch me grab it
See, I ain't ever seen a star this close
You got me stuck by the way you glow
I'm like oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm like oh, oh, oh, oh
Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer
Let's fly (fly,fly,fly,fly)
Up, up here we go, go
Up, up here we go, go
Let's fly (fly,fly,fly,fly)
Up, up here we go, go
Where we stop nobody knows
