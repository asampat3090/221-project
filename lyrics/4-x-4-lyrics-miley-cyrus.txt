[Chorus]
Round and round and away we go
Round and round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
[Verse 1]
I'm a female rebel can't you tell
Bang on the dashboard, shift in hell
Lean out the window that's when I yell
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Police want to get him and put him in jail
I'mma do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and [?]
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in that passenger seat riding high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plum out of gas
Let's go
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I'm a female rebel, can't you see
Riding around your backyard who could it be
Pull out on the scene [?]
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
He don't understand what he's doing to me
Deep down inside like a pitbull in heat
Someone's coming so we [?]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
It's 12 o'clock and I don't want to party
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well lie to L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls it off, he starts to yell,
He hits the gas so I grab the rail
[Bridge: Nelly]
Sure you want to ride with me
If you scared don't lie to me
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the midwest
With a Mississippi flow and a [?]
Four by four with the ultra steps
We doing donuts underneath the [?]
I need a chick on time don't mind being early
A ride or die dollar six thirty
A straight up chick like twelve o'clock
I don't know where you at
That's what you tell the cops
Take a stand for a nigga
Raise a hand for a nigga
I solemnly swear he was with me all day
Up to the judge, he know what I love
Hell he could tell, she don't even budge
Round and round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Outro]
I'm a female rebel can't you tell can't you tell
I'm a female rebel can't you tell can't you tell
