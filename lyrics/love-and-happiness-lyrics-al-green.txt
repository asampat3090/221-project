Love and happiness
Something that can, make you do wrong
Make you do right, love
Love and happiness
Wait a minute something's going wrong
Someone's on the phone
Three o'clock in the morning
Talkin' about, how she can make it right
Well, happiness is when
You really feel good, about somebody
Nothing wrong with being in love with someone
Oh baby, love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
Love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
Love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
Love and happiness
You be good to me
I'll be good to you
We'll be together
We'll see each other
Walk away with victory
Oh baby, love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
Love and happiness
(Love and happiness)
Make you do right, love'll make you do wrong
Make you come home early
Make you stay out all night long
The power of love
Wait a minute, let me tell you, about the power
The power of love, power, power
Make you do right, love'll make you do wrong
Love and happiness
Love and happiness
Love and happiness
Love and happiness
Make you want to dance, love and happiness
Love is, wait a minute
Love is, walkin' together, talkin' together
Say it again, say it together [Incomprehensible]
