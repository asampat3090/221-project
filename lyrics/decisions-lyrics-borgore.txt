Decisions, but I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing [x2]
You should have learned how to bake
Yes I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing [x2]
You should have learned bitches love cake!
Decisions, but I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing [x2]
You should have learned how to bake
Yes I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing [x2]
You should have learned how to bake
Decisions, between a family or a porn star
I'm alive for sports cars, live it or die whole bar
Headache for my management, gossip columns resident
Your mom and dad might hate me
But in five years I'm the president
I wanna girl, I get her, and I get her friend
Five girls singing in my bedroom, start my own band
They love me in my peak, but this love is fake
Everyday's my birthday, 'cause bitches love cake
Decisions, but I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing [x2]
You should have learned how to bake
Yes I want it all
So I get it all
I wanna eat the whole cake
I'm not sharing [x2]
You should have learned bitches love cake!
