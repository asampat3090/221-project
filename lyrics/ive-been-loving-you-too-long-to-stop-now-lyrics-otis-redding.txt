I've been loving you too long
To stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger
As you become a habit to me
Ooh, I've been loving you too long
I don't wanna stop now, oh
With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger
As our affair, affair grows old
I've been loving you oh too long
Don't want to stop now, oh, oh oh
I've been loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop now, oh, oh
Don't make me stop now, oh baby
I'm down on my knees
Please, don't make me stop now
I love you, I love you
I love you with all my heart
And I can't stop now
Please, please, please please no
Don't make me stop now, yeah oh
My heart and soul cryin'
