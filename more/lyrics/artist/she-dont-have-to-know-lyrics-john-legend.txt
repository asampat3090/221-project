Oh stealing moments just to be with you
Though its wrong its hard to tell the truth, oh no
She don't have to know she don't have to know
When I meet cha, I got my shades on to cover up my eyes
I'm hoping that nobody sees me passing by
Through my disguise I still know you recognize
But you I know you got a little secret of your own
Sneaking out with me while your mans at home
You know your wrong but its so strong still carrying on
I go to the other side of town and so I
Never risk the chance will catch her eye
Oh no, she don't have to know, she don't have to know
Oh girl I know your doing the same thing too
But I won't tell your man the things we do
Oh no, he don't have to know, he don't have to know
Someone's watching we got to be careful next time or we're through
But damn it's so stressful doing that dirt we do
So sad but true, and I know one day I'm gonna pay
Then he ask me to sneak out of town for just a day or three
Go to DC and hold hands publicly all through the streets
'Cause they don't know you and they don't know me
And oh I'll feel sorry for mistake we've made
There's no reason that we should tell her today
She don't have to know, she don't have to know
Girl oh, though you give a lot of love to me
Girl I know I'm not the only one you see
But he don't have to know, he don't have to know
Oh its getting crazy and I don't want to hurt my baby
And I'll know its supposed to be the last time for you and I
But let's not end this way just wait another day
Oh, I don't want to let you go and I
So I just can't let her go
She don't have to know, yeah, yeah
Oh I told you're doin' the same thing to her
Oh he told, they don't have to know
