Yeah, who'd thought that this little dude right here
Chris Brown, prissy boy from Tappahannock, Virginia
I ain't think this voice would get me this far

VA, this one's for y'all, baby
All my dudes in E-Town stay up
And for my team Mark Pitts, Tina Davis
Mom, Dad, I'm gonna make y'all proud
Alright, we here
