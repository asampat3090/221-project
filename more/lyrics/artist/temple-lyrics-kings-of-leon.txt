rock
The dance floor's a temptress
Can't make out what your saying
But you rub me the right way,
With your child-like persuasion
I got my hands in my pockets
And I'm crossing my fingers
She'll find I'm a simple
Stone washed up and so slow
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I feel all amiss now
I'm tossed in the scatter
And your eyes keep on shifting,
To the boys that don't matter
I've got my hands in my pockets
I'm still crossing my fingers
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I've got my hands in my pockets
And I'm crossing my fingers
I just want to be noticed
I just want to be noticed
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you oh
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
