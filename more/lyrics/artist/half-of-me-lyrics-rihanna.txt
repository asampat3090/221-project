You saw me on a television
Setting fire to all the buildings
Yeah I guess you saw me stealing
But you've no idea what I've been needing
Talk about when we were children
Not the kinda kid that you believe in
You saw me on a television
Saw me on a television
But that's just the half of it
Yeah you saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
You saw me on a television
Hanging out my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit and shake your head at my decisions
I guess the kinda songs that I've been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winning
But you saw me on a television
Yeah you saw on a television
But that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it, yeah
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
Oh you know me, I'm the life of the party
Beautiful people surround me
Everybody falling in love
Oh you know me, everybody knows that I'm crazy
Sticks and stones, they never break me
And I'm the type that don't give a fuck
And that's just the half of it
You saw the half of it
Yeah this the life I live
And that's just the half of it
Yeah you saw the half of it
And this is the life I live
You saw the half of it
Only the half of it, hey, no...
You saw me on a television
Saw me on a television
