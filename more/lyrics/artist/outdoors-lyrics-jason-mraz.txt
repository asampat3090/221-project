rock
All day I've been inside
And I've got the feeling
I'm trapped between the walls
And underneath the ceiling
I feel a bit off track
And now I'm trying to get back
Back in the cool cool air
Where the sun in shining
Nothing's gonna stop me
It's all in the timing
It's finally again my turn
It's time to return
Cause I won't stay inside
No more no more
I cannot wait to go outdoors
Mmmhmmhmmhmm
hey hey hey (Elmo)
Well open up your door
And be like me
Open up your door
And then breathe free
Look at all the beauty you'll feel
Love love love love
Listen to the music of the wind
And the birdies sing
We're just one big family
And all of nature deserves to be
Loved loved loved loved loved
So I won't stay inside
No more no more
It cannot wait
I'm sure
There's no need to run and hide
Let's go explore
It feels so great
Let's go outdoors
do do do do do do do do
Everyone come on
Come on out here
Where the air is fresh and clear
So I won't stay inside
No more no more
It cannot wait
Let's go outdoors
Jason:
Well open up your door
And be like me
Open up your door
And then breathe free
Look at all the beauty
And you'll find the earth
And the sky is yours
So please don't
There's no need
There's no need to hide inside
Let's go explore
This'll this'll
It feels so great
Let's go outdoors
Everybody else(at same time):
I won't stay inside
No more no more
It cannot wait
I'm sure
There's no need to run and hide
Let's go explore
It feels so great
Let's go outdoors
