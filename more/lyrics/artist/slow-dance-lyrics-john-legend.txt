pop
Yeah, sing it with me y'all, oh
Oh yeah, yeah, sing it
Can we wait just a minute?
Slow it down for a minute now, baby
You're talkin' loud, you're wilding out
Don't seem like my old lady
Let's go and play the song we used to play
Can we reignite the flame?
'Cause things just ain't the same
We can talk about the baby
We can talk until we're crazy
We can focus on it now
Or we can focus on it later
We can start another fight
We can argue and fuss all night
But I propose that we go
To floor and we slow dance
Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with your man, yeah?
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move, move, move
Can we wait just a minute?
Turn that TV off for a minute
Now politics and talkin' shit
Ain't really none of my business
Let's go and play the songs we used to play
On that old school radio
Let the music soothe your soul
Forget about the world
I'm groovin' with my girl
Forget about the news
Let's put on our dancin' shoes
Let's not talk about the war
Don't know what they fightin' for
I propose that we go
To the floor and we slow dance
Tonight I wanna dance
You can do that with your man, yeah
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move, move, move, move
Say, I love it, I love it
I love it we're slow dancin' together
Come on, I love it, I love it
I love it we're slow dancin' together
I love it, I love it
I love it we're slow dancin' together
I love it, I love it
I propose that we go to floor and we slow dance
Tonight I wanna dance
You can do that with your man, yeah
Tonight I wanna groove
Let the music make you move, move, move, move
