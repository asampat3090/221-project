rock
Weeds blow tall on a broken train track
Ruth B. draws, we're fixin' to get high
Maybe we'll hit the bluffs
And find ourselves the same old rum
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
The hopped up boys are lookin' for their trouble
The knocked up girls, well, they've all got their share
Ruth seems out of her mind, swears she won't give in this time
