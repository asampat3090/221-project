Up down, up down won't you give me a plenty girl
Are you? are you? you're my favorite girl
Are you? you're my favorite girl
Are you? you're my favorite girl.
Thinking of all 'playing a movie
Thinking of all, money are but a stand
So so so girl that I just play
So so so
Intoxicating tonight imagination baby
Intoxicating tonight, infatuation baby
Or you're just like
You're just like the cherry on top, if you bring the cake
I promise I'll flow your hand 'cause ..
You know that I love it when you talk like that
give me that back.
Up down, up down won't you give me a plenty girl
Are you? are you? you're my favorite girl
Are you? you're my favorite girl
Are you? you're my favorite girl.
Thinking of all ..right now
Thinking of all, money are but a stand
So so so girl that I just play
So so so
Intoxicating tonight imagination baby
Intoxicating tonight, infatuation baby
Or you're just like
You're just like the cherry on top, if you bring the cake
I promise I'll flow your hand 'cause ..
You know that I love it when you talk like that
give me that back.
Damn girl, damn girl
