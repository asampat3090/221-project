rock
Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
You're lovely with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight
With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
Yes, you're lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
Yes, you're lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Just the way you look tonight
Darling, just the way you look tonight
