No sleep today
Can't even rest when the sun's down
No time, there's not enough
And nobody's watching me now
When we were children we'd play
Out in the streets just dipped in fate
When we were children we'd say
That we don't know the meaning of
Fear, fear, fear
Fear, fear, fear
We don't know the meaning of
When we were children we'd play
Out in the streets just dipped in fate
When we were children we'd say
That we don't know the meaning of
Fear, fear, fear
Fear, fear, fear
We don't know the meaning of
Wish I didn't know the meaning of
