I know that we are young and I know you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro
Ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho
She's got both hands in her pockets
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger around you
You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke one cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Stop please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go
She's not broken, she's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gonna firefight, got cool the bad
You know that I love you, boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke one cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Don't bother me, don't bother me, Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name, bye Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, Fernando
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke one cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
(Alejandro, Alejandro)
nI'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernado
(Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro)
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
(Alejandro, Alejandro)
Just smoke one cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
(Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro)
Alejandro
