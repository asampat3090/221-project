pop
He was working at the record shop
I would kiss him in the parking lot
Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop

He would tell me I was beautiful
Sneaking in the neighbour's swimming pool
Yeah, he taught me how to break the rules

Hey, those days are long gone
But when I hear that song
It takes me back...
We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
17
Stealing beers out of the trailer park
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark
My favorite place was sitting in his car
17
We laid a blanket on the rooftop
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop
The nights were cold but we kept 'em hot

Hey, those days are long gone
But when I hear that song
It takes me back...
We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
We were running red lights
We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
Cause it was you and me
We were living the dream
We were 17
Ohhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh
I remember what it felt like
Just a small town kind of life
If only I could just go back in time
17
We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way its supposed to be
We were running red lights
We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
Cause it was you and me
We were living the dream
We were 17
