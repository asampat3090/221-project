Pitbull
pop
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that Im not the only one
All I gotta do is take you home
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
Its all I want
I got a feeling, that Im not the only one
Its all I want
And I got a feeling, that youre gonna give me some
Its all I want
Baby, its all I want
You know the type of women that I like
The ones that understand my life
The ones that understand wrong is right
Lets do some wrong tonight
You name it Ill do it, all is the fluid,
Im Spanish in fluent, that means my tongue is bilingual
Ready to play with that spot that you tingle
Uh got a dingo, shes a star, Ringo
Her and 2 friends? Mmm, I like that lingo
She asked if Im single,
I said of course not, and she loved it
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public
Hahaha
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that Im not the only one
All I gotta do is take you home
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
Its all I want
I got a feeling, that Im not the only one
Its all I want
And I got a feeling, that youre gonna give me some
Its all I want
Baby
Its all I want
You know I love an open mind
(mind)
So I can see what you thinking
(thinking)
That way I could give you exactly what you want
Matter of fact what you drinking
Some call it pimping, I call it leverage
I call it slipping, they call it marriage
She got me up like the Eiffel tower
No Paris, momma you can fuck like the rabbits
But no diamonds, no carrots
She asked if I was single, I said of course not
And she loved it
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that Im not the only one
All I gotta do is take you home
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
Its all I want
I got a feeling, that Im not the only one
Its all I want
And I got a feeling, that youre gonna give me some
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that Im not the only one
All I gotta do is take you home
I got a feeling, this party has just begun
Its all I want
I got a feeling, that Im not the only one
Its all I want
And I got a feeling, that youre gonna give me some
Its all I want
Baby its all I want
Baby Its all I want
Its all I want
Baby its all I want
