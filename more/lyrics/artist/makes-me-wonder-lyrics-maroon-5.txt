rock
I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between our thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feel so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye
Cant stop my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
Deal with things I've left unsaid
Want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
Get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
Even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feelin'
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
So this is goodbye
I've been here before, one day, a week
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie, I have no alibi
The words you said don't have a meaning 'cause
I still don't have a reason and you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
So this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
Even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feelin'
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye
Yeah, so this is goodbye
Yeah, so this is goodbye
