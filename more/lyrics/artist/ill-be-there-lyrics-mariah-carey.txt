You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love I'll be there
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
And build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad I found you yeah
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holdin' on
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness well it's all I'm after
Just call my name and I'll be there
I'll be there to protect you
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name and I'll be there
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
You know I'm so glad I found you yeah
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holdin' on
If you should ever find someone new
I know she'd better be good to you
'Cos if she doesn't then I'll be there
Don't you know baby, yeah, yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name and I'll be there
I'll be there baby
You know I'll be there
Just call my name and I'll be there
Just look over your shoulder
Just call my name and I'll be there
