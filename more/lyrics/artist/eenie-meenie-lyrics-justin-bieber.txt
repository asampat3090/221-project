pop
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla
If, if, if she holla, let her go
She's indecisive, she can't decide
She keeps on looking from left to right
Girl, come a bit closer, look in my eyes
Searching is so wrong, I'm Mr. Right
You seem like the type to love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after this song
So give me the night to show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone
You can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time
I'm not tryin' to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
'Cause shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Let me show you what you're missing, paradise
With me you're winning, girl, you don't have to roll the dice
Tell me what you're really here for
Them other guys? I can see right through ya
You seem like the type to love them and leave them
And disappear right after the song
So give me the night to show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancing alone
Can't make up your mind
Please don't waste my time
Not trying to rewind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
'Cause shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla
If, if, if she holla, let her go
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla, lolla, lolla
Let her go
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Can't make up your mind
Please don't waste my time
I'm not trying to rewind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
Shorty is a eenie, meenie, miney, mo, lova
