Look
I know girls love Beyonce
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing and shawty you aint no different
These days its hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
Ive been avoiding commitment
Thats why Im in this position
Im scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like its just me, but Im not alone
But if youre alone then, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you aint running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you (2x)
Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
Cause those other men are practice
And this aint no time for actin
And this aint no time for games
And this aint no time for uncertainty
And this aint no time for locking your phone and not coming home
and startin some shit when Im in the zone
This is why Ive been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys round me saying, Get money and fuck these hoes
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
Im just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone thatll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
Cause we dont wanna hide no more
Cause youre not shy no more
Neither one of us wanna play the side no more
No, Im not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you aint running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
