Oh I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Wrong turn on a dusty road
I did it too myself I cant pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God I must've been blind
Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
Cause once I get my hands on her, imma ooohh
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinkin' it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold diggin' bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named
Natalie, if you see her tell her i'm comin'
She better run
The good Lord better bless your soul
Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, please please please
And Im'ma look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night
I'll spend a lifetime in jail (yeah, that's what I'll do)
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah, thinking bout you)
Cant nobody save you now
So there ain't no use in tryin'
Once I get my hands on you, imma oooh
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinkin' it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold diggin' bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named
Natalie, if you see her tell her i'm comin'
She better run
I shoulda known better
Cuz when we were together
She never said forever
I'm a fool that paid in her game
Hey
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinkin' it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold diggin' bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named
Natalie, if you see her tell her i'm comin'
She better run
