Ooh, ooh, ahh
Star, star
I'm wishing
I'm wishing
On a star
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow rain never comes
And I'm wishing on all of the things we never done
I never thought I'd see the time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we spent
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
(Sow)
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together whether or never
I feel, it's time we should make up baby
I feel, it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
(Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
Hoping all the days to come and days to go
Hoping on the days of loving, loving you so
Wishing on a star, wishing on a dream
Baby, forgive me
Lets make up, I'm sorry
Lets be together, breakup? Never
The love we have seems special so far
'Til we get back, I'm wishing on a star
