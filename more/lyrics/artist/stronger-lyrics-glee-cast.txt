Hush, just stop
There's nothing you can do or say, baby
I've had enough
I'm not your property as from today, baby
You might think that I won't make it on my own
But now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I am stronger
Than I ever thought that I could be, baby
I used to go with the flow
Didn't really care 'bout me
You might think that I can't take it, but you're wrong
'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I am stronger
Come on now
Oh, yeah
Here I go on my own
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Here I go on my own, now
I don't need nobody, not anybody
Here I go
Alright
Here I go
Stronger than yesterday
It's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I am stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
Now I am stronger than yesterday
Now it's nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more, no more
I am stronger
