I've left you, twenty missed calls
Six messages, your voice mail's full
I call you back, call you back later
Something in my brain pulls at my heart
Dialing your number the ringing starts
You say hello baby I'll call you back later
A text feels like I've kissed you
A phone calls like you're here
When neither one, I'm like being in love, no
nowhere near
A voice mail is like I've seen you
A message is like we've touched
But a comment on my web page baby
It's not enough
Cause I feel like I'm in love with technology
Looking at the computer screen
Baby what do you mean to me
Was this ever real
Cause I feel like I'm in love with technology
Looking at the computer screen
Baby what do you mean to me
Was this ever real
Sign into my home page
Picked a comment u left yesterday
Said did you get my calls babe
I guess so
Click, uh uh
And I see your face
So, click click, uh
And I look away
Can I really love you
I don't know
An email's like I've seen you
I press send you disappear
Well that's not enough when your in love
No, nowhere near
Your face is a thousand pixels
Your asleep and I'll shut you down
Cause all this superficial love
It's not enough
Cause I feel like I'm in love with a technology
I'm looking at the computer screen
Baby what do you mean to me
Was it ever real
Cause I feel like I'm in love with a technology
I'm looking at the computer screen
Baby what do you mean to me
Was it ever real
When I first saw you
I added you as my friend
Don't be a stranger
Tell me was that pretend
See I can't help the way I feel
I keep telling myself
Skype isn't real
I feel like I'm in love with technology
I'm looking at the computer screen
And baby what do you mean to me
Was this ever real
Cause I feel like I'm in love with a technology
I'm looking at the computer screen
Baby what do you mean to me
Was this ever real
Tell me, was this ever real
