I wonder, wonder, wonder, why your eyes they wonder
I wonder, wonder wonder about the spell that you are under
Tell me it's some hocus pocus made you lose your focus
I wonder why the cold kiss and you think I wouldn't notice
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do, you do, you do
Can I get me some satisfaction?
Can I get me some satisfaction?
Can I get me some satisfaction?
That's all I'm asking of you, you, of you
Can I get me some satisfaction?
Give me some satisfaction
Give me the magic back that's all I ask of you
I wonder if it's over, middle of October
I don't know why in Autumn she keeps giving a cold shoulder
She knows how much I love her, don't know what I could have told her
I wonder why she makes me think I didn't even know her
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do, you do, you do
Can I get me some satisfaction?
Can I get me some satisfaction?
Can I get me some satisfaction?
That's all I'm asking of you, you, of you
Can I get me some satisfaction?
Give me some satisfaction
Oh, give me the magic back that's all I ask of you
Oh, why don't you give me?
(Give me, give me, give me, give me your love)
Give me your love
(Give me, give me, give me, give me your love)
Is that too much to ask you?
Can I get some satisfaction from you?
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do, you do, you do
Can I get me some satisfaction?
Can I get me some satisfaction?
Can I get me some satisfaction?
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you
Can I get me some satisfaction?
Give me some satisfaction
Give me the magic back that's all I ask of you
I wonder, wonder, wonder
I wonder, wonder, wonder
I wonder, wonder, wonder
I wonder, wonder, wonder
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, oh
