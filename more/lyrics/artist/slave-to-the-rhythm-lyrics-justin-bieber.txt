[Verse 1]
She dances in the sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep...
She dances at the brak of dawn
And quickly cook his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school
[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love
She dances for the man at work
Who works her all the time
She can't be rude as she says so
"I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
She sets his food an hour late
She must be out of her mind...
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And don't know it takes
And was all in vain.
Still she could not stop,
Couldn't break his chains
She danced the night
That they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But then she did, she did not quit
And she ran out the door
She danced through the night
In fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and
Swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed
Back home, home
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
A slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
A slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
A slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
A slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
A slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
