I can't sleep, no not like I used to
I can't breathe in and out like I need to
It's breaking ice now to make any movement
What's your vice? You know that mine's the illusion
All at once
(As I'm trying)
I can help you out
(Just to keep things right)
I'll be what you need, I'll do anything
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)
Goodbye apathy, so long apathy
So don't sit still
Don't you move away from here
So goodbye apathy
(As I'm trying)
So long fancy free
(Just to keep things right)
Goodbye apathy, I don't wanna be you
(Kill myself to make everything perfect for you)
I don't walk right, not like I used to
There's a jump in my step as I rush to see you
I could be happy here as long as you're near to me
As long as you're close to me
Now that I'm alright
(As I'm trying)
I can help you out
(Just to keep things right)
I'll be what you need, I'll do anything
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)
Goodbye apathy, so goodbye apathy
So don't you stop pushing me
I can take so much
So goodbye apathy
(As I'm trying)
So long fancy free
(Just to keep things right)
Goodbye apathy, I don't wanna be you
(Kill myself to make everything perfect for you)
Everybody is watching you
Everybody is watching me too
Everybody is watching you
Everybody is watching me too
(I can't sleep)
Everybody is watching you
(No)
Everybody is watching me too
(Not like I used to)
Everybody is watching you
(I can't breathe in)
Everybody is watching me too
(Not like I need to)
Everybody is watching you
(It's breaking ice now to make any movement)
Everybody is watching me too
Everybody is watching you
(What's your vice?)
Everybody is watching me too
(You know that mine's the illusion)
