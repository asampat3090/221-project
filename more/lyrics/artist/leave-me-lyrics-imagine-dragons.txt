Take a look inside
I've got nothing to hide - oh no...
I'll be around the boys
I've got nothing but time - on no... oh no
You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing is all I've got
Leave me, leave me, I'm shuttering all down
You've got a tendency to bring me down
I give up! I give up!
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run
So this is what it feels like
I'll give you the last word
It's alright... it's alright... it's alright
And this is the town, this is the place
If you are the one to give disgrace a name
So be it
You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing is all I've got
Leave me, leave me, I'm shuttering all down
You've got a tendency to bring me down
I give up! I give up!
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'm shuttering all down
You've got a tendency to bring me down
I give up! I give up!
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run
I'll take my car, I'll take my house
I never liked that beated motor home
and it looks so worn out then
just like a stranger in the mirror
Take take take take take it all
Leave me, leave me, I'm shuttering all down
You've got a tendency to bring me down
I give up! I give up!
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'm shuttering all down
You've got a tendency to bring me down
I give up! I give up!
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me now
Leave me now
