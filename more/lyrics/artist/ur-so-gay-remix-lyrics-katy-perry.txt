I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
You're so sad maybe you should buy a Happy Meal
You're so skinny you should really Supersize the deal
Secretly you're so amused
That nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry 'cause you'd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love
With someone that wears more makeup than
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
You're so gay, you're so gay
You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothing there
I wish you would just be real with me
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like penis
