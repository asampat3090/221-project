In the latest midnight hour
When the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You gotta get up
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself
I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world,
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
And myself
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself
Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on... Hold on
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself
