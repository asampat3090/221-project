Miley%20Cyrus
pop
I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must have known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm readin' the signs
That you can't wait to see me again
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart it can't rest 'til then
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again!
I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart it can't rest 'til then
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again
