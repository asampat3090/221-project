I'm sick of picking the pieces
And second guessing my reasons
Why you don't trust me
Why must we do this to one another
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it's over
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Well, I've got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
I'm racing the devil so sly
You cannot hear 'em coming
'Cause my defenses are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Oh my, I don't mind being the other guy
Nice try, for these games, I do not have the time
If you want me, call me, come and take a risk
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead
Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
