Mr. 305
Yeah!
[Intro]
We gonna rock the boat, rock it til it breaks down
Rock the boat, bring it through the underground
[Pitbull]
It's Mr Worldwide, yeah I'm marvelous
I'm so hot, I'm hotter than lava is
I don't know what you're thinkin' but I hope you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
Won't you show head bobblin'
Don't knock on doors, but Jehovah's my witness
And I treat sex like it's psychical fitness
Up and down like the stock market
Now baby let me give you the business
Cara linda, pecho hecho
Ay que rico, dale chica
Pelo lacio, mira eso,
Dale loca, dame un beso
[Chorus]
We're gonna rock the boat, rock it til it breaks down
Rock the boat, hop it til it can't be found
Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping
Rockin' rockin', keep on poppin'
Rock the boat, bring it through the underground
CLAP YOUR HANDS...
Let's Go!
[Dragonfly]
Tonight I'm thirsty and I'm drinking like a grizzly bear
Cause I'm on fire like a chilli super that you can stare
I got a lighting ball in my hair,
Let's party dirty all the way my dear
We're gonna rock the boat
(Baby you gon' see you'll be riden with me)
Rock the boat
(Baby you gon' see you'll be rolling with me)
We're gonna rock the boat
(Baby you gon' see you'll be rocking with me)
Rock the boat
(You gon' be rocking and rolling with me)
[Chorus]
We're gonna rock the boat, rock it til it breaks down
Rock the boat, hop it til it can't be found
Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping
Rockin' rockin', keep on poppin'
Rock the boat, bring it through the underground
CLAP YOUR HANDS...
Let's Go!
Fatman Scoop, Bob Sinclair
We get it on, LOUDER!
We're gonna rock the boat
(What you want to do now)
Rock the boat
(Make it louder, make it louder)
We're gonna rock the boat
(How we get the party started)
Rock the boat
(Make it louder, make it louder)
[Outro]
We gonna rock the boat, rock it til it breaks down
Rock the boat, bring it through the underground
