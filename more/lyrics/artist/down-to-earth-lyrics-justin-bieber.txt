Ohhh,ohhh,oh
I never thought that it'd be easy,
Cause we're both so distant now,
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering how,
No one has a solid answer,
But just walking in the dark,
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart.
So we fight, (so we fight)
Through the hurt, (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry,
Then we live, (then we live)
And we learn, (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try!
So its up to you, (oh)
And its up to me, (yeah)
and we meet in the middle, on our way back down to earth,
Down to earth, down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth,
Back down to earth x8
Mommy, you were always somewhere,
And Daddy, I live out of town,
So tell me how could I ever be, normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best,
So tell me why am I in tears?
(Woo) so far away and now I just need you here,
So we fight, (so we fight)
Through the hurt, (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry,
And we live, (and we live)
And we learn, (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you,
And its up to me,
And we meet in the middle, on our way back down to earth,
Down to earth x3
On our way back down to earth, (on our way back down to earth)
Back down to earth x8
I felt so far away,
From where we used to be,
And now we're standing,
And where do we go,
when there's is no road (no road)
to get to your heart?
Lets start over again!
So it's up to you,
And it's up to me,
And we meet in the middle, on our way back down to earth,
Down to earth, (down to earth)
Down to earth,
On our way back down to earth,
I never thought that it'd be easy,
Cause we're both so distant now,
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering how?
