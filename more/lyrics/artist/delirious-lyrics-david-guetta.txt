Seems to me like the days are getting longer
For everyone there's no fun when there's no time to sleep
Working on and on for a day in the sun
Counting down the days till it stops
Can you hear us, watch the sun on my skin?
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us with a smile on my face?
On a far different place I'm delirious
Can you hear us, watch the sun on my skin?
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us with a smile on my face?
On a far different place I'm delirious
Take me away, make me a holiday
Delirious
Take me away, make me a holiday
Delirious
Under the sun I feel I'm getting stronger
Time to rewind my mind, recharge my batteries
'Cause it takes so long and too soon it's gone
Holding back the days to my reality
Take me away, make me a holiday
Take me away, make me a holiday
Delirious
Can you hear us, watch the sun on my skin?
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us with a smile on my face?
On a far different place I'm delirious
Can you hear us, watch the sun on my skin?
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us with a smile on my face?
On a far different place I'm delirious
Take me away, make me a holiday
Delirious
Take me away, make me a holiday
Delirious
Can you hear us, watch the sun on my skin?
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us with a smile on my face?
On a far different place I'm delirious
Can you hear us, watch the sun on my skin?
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us with a smile on my face?
On a far different place I'm delirious
