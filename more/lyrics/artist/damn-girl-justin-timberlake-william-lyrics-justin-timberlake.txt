Listen to me
I've been around the world
Seen a million hunnies
Really special girls
Gave all my time and money
But, there something 'bout ya
Something that's kinda funny
It's what you do to me
awwwww
Don't need no Maybelline
'Cause you're a beauty queen
Don't need no L'oreal
'Cause bitch you're bad as hell
If I'm a Casanova?
Then you're a supernova
Girl it's what you do to me
It's got me saying
Damn girl...... you're so fine
The way you let me put it down, girl
Blows my mind
I guess I gotta put it down tonight
I gotta put it down
Ohh , Ohh Ohh
Damn

When I'm dreaming I'm dreaming of you
When you're gone I've been screaming for ya
So why don't you be my chick and stuff
Take you out to dinner and catch the funky stuff?
If we spend time I'll never get enough
You're so fine make a brother blush
Got me looking like a black grape and stuff
First time saying you had me gonna crush
And if you ever give it to me
Give it to me rough
You got me saying...(You got me saying)
