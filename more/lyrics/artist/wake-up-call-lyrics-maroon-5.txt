I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say 'we'?
I never would've made it, baby
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could've given love, now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don't say a word
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't think so!
I would've bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you've beat me at my own game
And now I found you sleeping soundly
And your love is screaming loudly
I hear a sound and hit the ground
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could've given love, now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don't say a word
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so bad
I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so!
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here, I don't feel so bad
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Care about me? I don't think so!
Six foot tall, came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't feel so bad
Wake up call, caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
