rock
Toss me a breath when you hold me down
Hot like a razor on my face
Somethings growing that don't help me now
Paging the doctor just in case
Low and behold things are killing me
Silly expectation of a dream
Girls are gonna love the way I toss my hair
Boys are gonna hate the way I seem
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Peach Christmas lights spitting German ling
Feels like a fast or homeless sleep
At least there's a record that I love to play
Dreaming about a place I'll never see
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Betty, Betty, Annie is a praying
Baby with a man like a lung
Smell her crying fighting back a fever
Mad as hell give up
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old
Day old, day old, day old blues
