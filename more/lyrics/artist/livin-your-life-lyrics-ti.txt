[VERSE 1 - T.I.]
Hey, Never mind what haters say, ignore them 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful for after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way, for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wasting days away, now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protg, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love them in a crazy way
Some say they so yay and no they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded gray
I'm west side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away
Like I once made them spray, now I could make them put their taze away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
If you ever see me catch a case, and watch my future fade away
[CHORUS]
(Hey, hey, yeah) You're gonna be a shining star (That's right)
(Yeah, okay, yeah) With fancy clothes and fancy ca-ars (Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
(See, yeah)And then you'll see, you're gonna go far (Go, hey)
Cause everyone knows (They know), just who you a-are
(Hey!)So live your life, (Ay!, Ay ay ay)
You steady chasing that paper
Just live your life (Oh!, Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (Ay!, Ay ay ay)
No telling where it'll take you
Just live your life (Oh!, ay ay ay)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (Ay) (Ma ya hee)
My life (Oh!) (Ma ya haa)
My life (Ay!) (Ma ya hoo)
My life (Oh!) (Ma ya ha ha)
Just livin' my life (Ay!) (Ma ya hee)
My life (Oh!) (Ma ya haa)
My life (Ay!) (Ma ya hoo)
My life (Oh!) (Ma ya ha ha)
[VERSE 2 - T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever having problems with, their record sales just holla Tip
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it
'Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguing
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of whats important with the positive
And checks until your bank account and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizing horribly
Unhappy with your riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignoring all prior advice and forewarning
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?
[CHORUS]
(Hey, hey, yeah) You're gonna be a shining star (That's right)
(Yeah, okay, yeah) With fancy clothes and fancy ca-ars (Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
(See, yeah)And then you'll see, you're gonna go far (Go, hey)
Cause everyone knows (They know), just who you a-are (Okay, now)
(Hey!)So live your life, (Ay!, Ay ay ay)
You steady chasing that paper
Just live your life (Oh!, Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (Ay!, Ay ay ay)
No telling where it'll take you
Just live your life (Oh!, ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (Ay) (Ma ya hee)
My life (Oh!) (Ma ya haa)
My life (Ay!) (Ma ya hoo)
My life (Oh!) (Ma ya ha ha)
Just livin' my life (Ay!) (Ma ya hee)
My life (Oh!) (Ma ya haa)
My life (Ay!) (Ma ya hoo)
My life (Oh!) (Ma ya ha ha)
[VERSE 3 - Rihanna]
Got everybody watching what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not going away
So keep on gettin' 'ya paper (Ah)
And keep on climbin' (Ah)
Look in the mirror (Ah)
And keep on shinin' (Shinin')
'Til the game end,
'Til the clock stop,
We 'gon post up on the top stop
Livin' my life (My life) (Ma ya hee)
My life (My life) (Ma ya haa)
Got a brand new CD (Ma ya hoo)
Got my whole team livin' life (My life) (Ma ya ha ha, ma ya hee)
My life (Ma ya haa)
I do it how I wanna do (Ma ya hoo)
I'm livin' my life (My life)
My life (My life)

I'm livin' my life
My life
And I'm not stoppin'
