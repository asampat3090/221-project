OneRepublic
pop
I-I-I
I'm sinking in
You know that something's got to
Something's gotta give
And then you told yourself
You found a modern mona lisa
You gave her all your love
You said 'I pray this fool could keep her'
You got no money
It doesn't mean a thing
You got time
And time is everything
Knock all night
Stay awake
Listening to
Records that you like
Now you're saying
I-I-I
I'm sinking in
You know that something's got to
Something's gotta give
Ooooh
And then you showed yourself
All the colors that you fear
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It doesn't mean a thing
You got love
So you got everything
Talk all night
Stay awake
Listening to
Records that we like
I-I-I
I'm sinking in
You know that something's got to
Something's gotta give
It's gotta give
Oh whoa oh, whoa oh [x4]
Something's gotta give
It's gotta give
It's gotta give
Oh whoa oh, whoa oh
