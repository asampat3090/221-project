Katy%20Perry

I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
He introduced me, was always just a friend
I bought a new dress, he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman
Oh love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
You were such a surprise, an unexpected gift
Said I was pretty and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you and this is just a phase
Could I get used to being loved the right way?
I wanna argue but there is nothing to say
Oh love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready
Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah, we talk for hours, you still wanna listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way
But love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready
