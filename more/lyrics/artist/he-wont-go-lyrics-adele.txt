Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail to climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague, broken boy instead
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust but nothing will ever taint us
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
Will he? Will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place
Where he would choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
You said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home so soon, I won't be late
He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
