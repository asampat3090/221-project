I would never have known
The way it feels to love without the love you showered down upon me
Warm, warm as the sun
Melting away the rain giving me strengh to face another morning
So many times I felt afraid and turn to you to find my way
I reach inside to find you there
You were with me everywhere
All
(I could search for all my life to find)
It would take all
(Someone to be there till the end of time)
All of my life to find
(Everywhere I look I'll never find)
Someone more there for me
There for me
And I'm
( When I feel like I am all alone)
Never Alone
(You are closer than I've ever known)
'Cause in my heart I know
( You're always with me in my heart I know)
Your always there for me,there for me
I, I won't let go
Of precious memories
They are the light of hope that burns inside me
And every time I lose my way
You shine for me and I'm okay
You lift me way beyond it all
And You never let me fall
All
(I could search for all my life to find)
It would take all
(Someone to be there till the end of time)
All of my life to find
(Everywhere I look I'll never find)
Someone more there for me
There for me
And I'm
( When I feel like I am all alone)
Never Alone
(You are closer than I've ever known)
'Cause in my heart I know
( You're always with me in my heart I know)
Your always there for me,there for me
You'll always catch me when I fall
All, it would take all
All of my life to find
Someone more there for me, there for me
And I'm never alone
'Cause in my heart I know
You're always there for me, there for me, I know
All
(I could search for all my life to find)
It would take all
(Someone to be there till the end of time)
All of my life to find
(Everywhere I look I'll never find)
Someone more there for me
There for me
And I'm
( When I feel like I am all alone)
Never Alone
(You are closer than I've ever known)
'Cause in my heart I know
( You're always with me in my heart I know)
Your always there for me,there for me I know
Your always there
With me everywhere
And if I lose my way
I am never alone
Your always there
With me everywhere
And if I lose my way
I am never alone
Your always there
With me everywhere
And if I lose my way
I am never alone
Your always there
With me everywhere
And if I lose my way
I am never alone
