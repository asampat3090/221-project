Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby?
Right now I feel invisible to you, like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away? Here's what I have to say
I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there
Grinnin' with a lost stare
That's when I decided
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm startin' to trip, I'm losin' my grip
And I'm in this thing alone
Am I just some chick you placed beside you
To take somebody's place?
When you turn around can you recognize my face?
You used to love me, you used to hug me
But that wasn't the case, everything wasn't okay
I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there
Grinnin' with a lost stare
That's when I decided
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm startin' to trip, I'm losin' my grip
And I'm in this thing alone
Cryin' out loud, I'm cryin' out loud
Cryin' out loud, I'm cryin' out loud
Open your eyes
Open up wide
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
Why should I care?
If you don't care, then I don't care
We're not goin' anywhere
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
Why should I care?
If you don't care, then I don't care
We're not goin' anywhere
