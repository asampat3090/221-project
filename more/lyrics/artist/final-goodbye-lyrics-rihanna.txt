I never should have waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret, I've held all my life
It's you that I live for and for you I die
So I'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently, as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret, I've held all my life
It's you that I live for and for you I die
So I'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye
Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret, I've held all my life
It's you that I live for and for you I die
So I'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye
His respectful lips for the last time
Spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
It's you that I live for and for you I die
So I'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye, goodbye
