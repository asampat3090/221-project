This one right here...
Goes out to my mama,
(This Goes out to mama)
Your mama,
And everybody mama (haha)
Here we go... listen listen
[Verse 1:]
I remember Saturday mornin's
Me wakin' up to mama in the kitchen cookin' and spam cookin'
I was just a young dude, watchin' mornin' cartoons, waitin' for mama to braid my hair
I used to hate to get it done, cause she'd braid it too tight
My mama always gave a style she knew I would like, and then
I would go outside and play, she'd sit on the front porch
While me and Rob played ball
[Bridge:]
Mama always did little things like that
Mama always will know I love her for that
For all the things that you used to do...
Mama I dedicate this one to you
[Chorus:]
It's straight from the heart
This is your song
You're my lucky charm so you already know,
That I'm a sing this one for you, so let me sing this one for you
From every tour, every show
You're my lucky charm, go wherever I go
Mama I'm a sing this one to you, mama let me sing this one to you
[Verse 2:]
She's like the mother of Tappahannock, VA
Everybody knew miss Joyce, where we stayed
All heads said she was cool, nothing' that she wouldn't do
But about CB, she was know to act a fool (whoawhoa)
With the little money that she made
She took the bed and made it all okay
Nights with the dickies, when we had to stay there
Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now
[Bridge:]
Mama always did little things like that (oh)
Mama always will know (aye) I love her for that
For all the things that you used to do...
Mama I dedicate this one to you
[Chorus:]
It's straight from the heart
This is your song
You're my lucky charm so (so you already know) you already know,
That I'm a sing this one for you, so let me sing this one for you
From every tour (from every tour o yea yea), every show
You're my lucky charm (you're my lucky charm), go wherever I go
Mama I'm a sing this (I'm a sing it) one to you, (Just let me sing it)
Mama let me sing (whoa yea) this one to you
[Verse 3:]
(oo'oo)
Mama I thank you for all you've done (oo'oo)
I thank God everyday I'm your son (oh)
(You gave) You gave me everything that I need
But lovin' me unconditionally...
Everybody say... "M-O-M-M-A"
Everybody say... mama
"M-O-M-M-A"
You know that this is your song
[Chorus:]
It's straight from the heart (oh mama)
This is your song (aye)
You're my lucky charm so you already know, (you already know)
That I'm a sing this one for you, so let me sing this one for you
From every tour (aye), every show (mama I love you so)
You're my lucky charm, go wherever I go (wherever I go)
Mama I'm a sing this one to you (yeah),
Mama let me sing this one to you
[Interlude:]
This right here goes out to every mama all over the world
Mama I know I might be bad at times (mama I'm a sing this one to you)
I might get on your nerves, but I still love you (mama let me sign this one to you)
You always gon be my mama
