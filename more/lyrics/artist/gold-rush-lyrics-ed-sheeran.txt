Smoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eyes
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive, hey
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do
But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is hold up
and remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown ups
Didn't learn a thing
But then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything
Other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You want to be loved
I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words
To a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do
But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is hold up
and remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown ups
Didn't learn a thing
But then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything
Other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You want to be loved
Hey
But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is hold up
and remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown ups
Didn't learn a thing
But then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything
Other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You want to be loved
