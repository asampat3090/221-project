Paramore
rock
Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry
So go on go on just walk away
Go on go on your choice is made
Go on go on and disappear
Go on go on away from here
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you, without you
Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside
So come back, come back, don't walk away
Come back, come back, come back today
Come back, come back, why can't you see?
Come back, come back, come back to me
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you, without you
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
