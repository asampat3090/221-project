Talk to myself again, all alone, on my own
Walk by the scene again, just to see what people see
Caught in your stubborn hold and Im so far from home
So turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on for me
So keep the lights on, keep the lights on
Keep the lights on for me
Dont go to sleep
Lost in your thoughts again, consciously you think of me
Focus your perfect words, with a pen you write me in
I cant be reached so far from here, I need you near
So turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on for me
So keep the lights on, keep the lights on
Keep the lights on for me
Dont go to sleep
I wait for you, I stay for you
So turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on for me
So keep the lights on, keep the lights on
Keep the lights on for me
Dont go to sleep
I wait for you, I stay for you
