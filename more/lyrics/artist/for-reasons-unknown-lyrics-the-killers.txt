rock
I pack my case, I check my face
I look a little bit older
I look a little bit colder
With one deep breath, and one big step
I move a little bit closer, I move a little bit closer
For reasons unknown
I caught my stride, I flew it by
I know if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my mind
Well my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don't see you no more
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don't recognize you no more
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
It was an open chair
We sat down in, the open chair
I said if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my mind
But my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don't see you no more
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don't recognize you at all
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
I said my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to
And my eyes don't recognize you no more
And my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don't recognize you no more
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
