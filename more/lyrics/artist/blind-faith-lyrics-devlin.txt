Devlin
metal
I am a man with a heavy heart,
and I dare not tear the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
I...
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation
Listen music that we play, somehow gets glued to your brain
I'm the future when I'm in the boost I'm like I'm living in 3008
This music gave me a lane to ride in, but there aint' cars in the sky yet, so hold tight
Because I'm in flight like a plane with a [?] of a lion
You know why? Because I got pole bars hard like crowbars
you can't gamble with no cards
what d'you wanna call it then you get stung like a phone charge
Music mentally uses me like a sailor might use sonar
to find where the flows are, upon an ocean floor that's so dark
Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
Listen, listen, the music that we play
Will ease your mind
My heart falls heavy, like a bankers belly
But when I'm writing songs, I'm happy like chunk when you got away from the Portellies
And there's a musical vibe that usually moves inside of my mind
Therefore I've got a fortune already, and I ain't even talking in pennies
So ride on, my faith is blind like a man who requires a guide dog
And life's wrong, but I stride on regardless of anything I am strong
I got all that I need in a mic and a beat to see how alive I can be
And I got sweet sensation inside of me, because my mind's ease
I am a man with a heavy heart,
and I dare not tear the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
I...
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation
Listen, I wanna say rest in peace, for children murdered on U.K. streets
when a country wages a war there's a war going on in our very own streets
And I say that life's too short, to end up in the move of a cool
So why not give music a fall and use it to dive like a hawk
Listen, we all get down in the dumps
but when they hear the melody and base line pump
I feel my heart rate jump through the roof and then I run loose on my tongue
Confer with Morpheus if you need proof I'm the one
Or I'll put my heart on the scales to prove that my cardiac muscle weighs more than a ton
Sweet sensation
The music that we play
Will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
Listen, listen, the music that we play
Will ease your mind
I am a man with a heavy heart,
And I dare not tear the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation.
