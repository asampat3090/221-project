I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I'm feelin' sexy, I wanna hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me, you can feel my burning flame
Feelin' kind of N A S T Y
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe is just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy, babe
Babe, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
You're so sexy, tonight I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor
Feelin' kind of N A S T Y
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe is just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy, babe
Babe, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
