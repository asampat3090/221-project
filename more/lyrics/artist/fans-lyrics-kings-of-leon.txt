Kings%20of%20Leon
rock
Homegrown
Rock to the rhythm and bop to the beat of the radio
You ain't got the slang but you've got the face to play the roll
You can play with me
And all the bros
Try for the courage
And try for Charity's tight clothes
She's got a hat
And all the hat says is asshole
She'll be bobbing to me
Pretty hairdos
And those lipstick kisses
Blown yeah, that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who moves you
The only one you see
Now take me down
Don't you let those tears quench the thirsty ground
Don't you be so scared that you can't make a sound
Make a sound for me
All of London sing
'cause England swings and they sure love the tales I bring
Those rainy days they ain't so bad when you're the King, the King they wanna see
Homegrown
(so) Rock to the rhythm and bop to the beat of the radio
You ain't got the slang but you have the face to play the roll
You can play with me
Pretty hairdos
And those lipstick kisses
And all you asked for is ragoo
Make me feel like I'm the one who moving you
The only one you see
All of London sing
'cause England swings and they sure love the tales I bring
Those rainy days they ain't so bad when you're the King, the King they wanna be
