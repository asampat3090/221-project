Today, I'm gonna write a sad song
Gonna make it really long
So that everyone can see
That I'm very unhappy
I wish I wasn't always wrong
I wish it wasn't always my fault
The finger that you're pointing
Has knocked me on my knees
And all you need to know is
I'm so sorry, it's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow
I wonder what my mom and dad would say
If I told them that I cry each day
It's hard enough to live so far away
I wish it wasn't always cold
I wish I wasn't always alone
When the party is over,
How will I get home?
And all you need to know is
I'm so sorry, it's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow
If all the rules are meant to bend
And you swore you were my friend
Now I have to start all over again
Cause no one's going to take your place
And I'm scared I'll never save
All the pieces of the love we made
But I'm so sorry, it's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know
That I can slip and fall
And you won't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow
And I'm so sorry, it's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know
That growing up goes slow
