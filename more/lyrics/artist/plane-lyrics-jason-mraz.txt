rock
Drain the veins in my head
Clean out the reds in my eyes to get by security lines
Dear x-ray machine
Pretend you don't know me so well, I won't tell if you lied
Cry, 'cause your drought's been brought up
Drinkin' cause you're lookin' so good in your Starbucks cup
I complain for the company that I keep
The windows for sleepin', rearrange when I'm nobody
Well, who's laughin' now? I'm leaving your town, again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air so baby, hell, yeah
Well honey, I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
Well, I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
Damn, I should be so lucky
Even only 24 hours under your touch
You know I need you so much
I cannot wait to call you
And tell you that I landed somewhere
And hand you a square of the airport
And walk you through the maze of the map that I'm gazing at
Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck
And the look that you gave me
You make me somebody, oh, nobody knows me
Not even me can see it, yet I bet
I'm leaving your town again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air, so baby, hell, yeah
Oh honey, I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
Get me high minded
You keep me high
Flax seeds, well they tear me open
And supposedly you could crawl right through me
Taste these teeth, please
And undress me from the sweaters, better hurry
'Cause I'm heeding upward bound now
Oh, maybe I'll build my house on your cloud
Here I'm tumbling for you
Stumbling through the work that I have to do
Don't mean to harm you
By leaving your town again
But I'm over the quilt that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air, said baby, hell, yeah
Oh honey, I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
Damn, damn, damn, damn you
You get me high
And you keep me high minded
You get me high
You get me high minded
