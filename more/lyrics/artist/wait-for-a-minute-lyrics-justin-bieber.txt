Wait just A Minute
Can Wait just A Minute?
Here you are, with me
And if you take my hand babe
We can go to a place, you ain't never seen before
Slow dance in the moonlight
I'm just trying to set the mood right
I'm just doing what a dude do
Do it over and over and over
Quick thing wanna run with me now
Swift thing just come with me now
Good steps go to the beat now
Over and over and over
It's just the way, that way, that way, that do it babe
All I can say, that say, the say that I'm the it
But I'd be lying babe
Just wanna wait for a minute
Wait for a minute
[Tyga - Rap Vese]
Hold up, I don't need no love
I said that with a straight face, baby that's poker
Feel a lil sober, got it mixed in my soda
I clean up good, aropa, dopa
Baby I'm the shit but that's a good odor
I'm a young star but my money look Yoda
Crib on the ocean, backyard boat shit
You hating on the internet, I couldn't even notice
Tickets no service, we at the top working
Pop-pops is lurking, told her "don't get nervous"
I don't swerve Suburbans, this a gold derby
Ferarri's and horses, I snap like Torres
No rug, I floor it, girl, come feel important
I'm all about a dollar, babe, banks call me Georgi
9-5 Rollie, 96 Kobe, tonight we gon' ball like Ginobili
You know me, I'm just tryna...
Slow dance in the moonlight
I'm just trying to set the mood right
I'm just doing what a dude do
Do it over and over and over
Quick thing wanna run with me now
Swift thing just come with me now
Good steps go to the beat now
Over and over and over
It's just the way, that way, that way, that do it babe
All I can say, that say, the say that I'm the it
But I'd be lying babe
Just wanna wait for a minute
Wait for a minute
