Well the morning was complete
There was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak
It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to breaking off, to start to fall apart
Hold on to your heart
Do me a favour, break my nose
Do me a favour, and tell me to go away
Do me a favour, and stop asking questions
She walked away, well, her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
And I watched and I waited 'til she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye.
Curiousity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiousity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold
Do me a favour, and ask if you need some help
She said: "Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"
How to tear apart the ties that bind?
Perhaps fuck off, might be too kind
Perhaps fuck off, might be too kind
