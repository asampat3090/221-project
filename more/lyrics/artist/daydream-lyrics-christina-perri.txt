Finally your time has come
Now's my chance to turn and run
Like I always do
Build a story in my head
It was love before we met
Happy with my idea with you
Stay where you are
Please don't break my heart
Love you in my daydream
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth
Everything I'll ever need
Spoil it now, spoil it now
You stood up and I fell down
Watching me, watching you
I know what you wanna do
But I'm afraid of my wish coming true
So I paint a picture in my mind
That I go back to older times
It's better than being with you
Stay where you are
Please don't break my heart
Love you in my daydream
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth
Everything I'll ever need
Spoil it now, spoil it now
You stood up and I fell down
I don't know how to come down
I was lost and now I am found
You stood up and I fell down
Love you in my daydream
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth
Everything I'll ever need
Spoil it now, spoil it now
Love you in my daydream
Don't open your mouth, open your mouth
Everything I'll ever need
Spoil it now, spoil it now
Love you in my daydream
