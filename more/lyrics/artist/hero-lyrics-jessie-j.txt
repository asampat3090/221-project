I'm gonna be risky
Life and soul of the party
No more stressing me out
Pulling me down
Making me feel like I am better off lonely
I'm gonna be fearless
And take care of my business
You stopped keeping me safe
I need to be brave
Shout it out
Shout it out
Shout it, shout it every day now
Try steal my powers right from me
Just like a criminal
But I won't have it
I'm not flying into your arms, no
I never thought that you'd drain the fight out of me
Oops, look what you did to me
Now I figured out
I don't need no hero-oooo...
I can save myself no hero-oooo-oooo...
Anything is possible, feeling indestructible
I don't need no hero-oooo...
I don't need no hero
I'm living dangerous
For what you did, I'll make you pay for it
See, I know that you're scared
Watching me over head
Watch me, watch-watch me now
I see you watch me every day now
Can't steal my powers right from me
Just like a criminal
But I won't have it
I'm not flying into your arms
I never thought that you'd drain the fight out of me
Oops, look what you did to me
Now I figured out
I don't need no hero-oooo...
I can save myself no hero-oooo-oooo...
Anything is possible, feeling indestructible
I don't need no hero-oooo...
I don't need no hero
I don't need no hero
I don't need no hero
I don't need no hero
I don't need no hero
I don't need no hero-oooo...
I can save myself no hero-oooo-oooo...
Anything is possible, feeling indestructible
I don't need no hero-oooo...
I don't need no hero
