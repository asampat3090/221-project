The world as I see it, is a remarkable place
A beautiful house in a forest, of stars in outer space.
From a birds eye view, I can see it has a well-rounded personality
From a birds eye view, I can see we are family.
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing.
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Because you are the world to me.
Yeah the world as I see it, is a remarkable place
Every man makes a difference
And every mothers child is a saint
From a birds eye view I can see, we are spiralling down in gravity
From a birds eye view I can see, you are just like me.
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing.
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Unconditionally.
No it's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing.
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Because you are the world to me.
You are the mountain, you are the rock
You are the court and you're the spark
You are the eagle, you are the lark
You are the world and you're remarkable
You're the ocean beating the shore
You are the calm inside the storm
You're every emotion, you can endure
You are the world, the world is yours.
(It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
No it's not a difficult thing.
It's not hard for me to love you
Hard for me to love you
Unconditionally)
