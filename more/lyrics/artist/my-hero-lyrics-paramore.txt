Too alarming now, to talk it out
Take your pictures down, and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out
Truth or consequence say it aloud
Use that evidence race it around
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
Kudos my hero
Leaving all the best
You got my hero
One that's on
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
