Paramore
rock
Down to you
You're pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don't know what I
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
From saying something that I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
From saying something that I should've never thought of you
Of you
You're pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don't know what I want
No, I don't know what I want
You got it, you got it, some kind of magic
Hypnotic, hypnotic, you're leaving me breathless
I hate this, I hate this, you're not the one I believe in
With God as my witness
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
From saying something that I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
From saying something that I should've never thought of you
Of you
You're pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don't know what I want
No, I don't know what I want!
Don't know what I want
But I know it's not you
Keep pushing and pulling me down
When I know in my heart it's not you
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
From saying something that I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself, I had to stop myself
From saying something that I should've never thought of you
I knew
I know in my heart it's not you, I knew
But now I know what I want, I want, I want
Oh no, I've should have never thought!
