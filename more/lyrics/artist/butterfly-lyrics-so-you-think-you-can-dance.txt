So%20You%20Think%20You%20Can%20Dance
other
I'm taking a moment just imagining that Im dancing with you
Im your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes
You got soul, you know what to do to turn me on
Until I write a song about you
And you have your own engaging style
And you've got the knack to vivify
And you make my slacks a little tight
You may unfasten them if you like
Thats if you crash and spend the night
But you don't fold, you don't fade
You got everything you need, especially me
Sister, you've got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk
Sister, you've got it all
You got it all
Curl your upper lip up and let me look around
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip then bite down
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
'Cause they're the perfect jumping off point
Getting closer to your butterfly
Will you float on by?
Oh, kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right
But you don't fold, you don't fade
You got everything you need, especially me
Sister, you've got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk
Sister, you've got it all
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
You got it all, woo, hey baby, uh
You've got it all
Doll, I need to see you pull your knee socks up
Let me feel you upside down, slide in, slide out
Slide over here, climb into my mouth now child
Butterfly well you landed on my mind
Damn right you landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
And now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
I want to fly with you and I don't want to lie to you
'Cause I, 'cause I can't recall a better day
So Im coming to shine on the occasion
You're an open-minded lady, you've got it all
And I never forget a face
Except for maybe my own, I have my days
And lets face the fact here
It's you who's got it all
You know that fortune favors the brave
Well let me get paid while I make your breakfast
The rest is up to you, you make the call
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk
Sister, you've got it all
I can't recall a better day
So Im coming to shine on the occasion
Hey sophisticated lady, oh you got it all
You got it all, you got it all
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all
You got it all! Hey! You got it all, woo!
You got it all
You got it all
You got it all
Butterfly, baby, well you got it all
