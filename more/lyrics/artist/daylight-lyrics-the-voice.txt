Here I am waiting, Ill have to leave soon, why am I holdin on
We knew this day would come, we knew it all along
How did it come so fast
This is our last night, but its late and I'm tryin not to sleep
Cuz I know, when I wake I will have to slip away
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But, tonight Im gonna hold you so close
Cuz in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But, tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
Here I am starring, at your perfection in my arms; so beautiful.
The sky is getting bright, the stars are burnin out.
Somebody slow it down.
This is way too hard, cuz I know when the sun comes up I will leave
This is my last glance that will soon be memories
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But, tonight Im gonna hold you so close
Cuz in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But, tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
I never wanted to stop, because I don't want to start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark, but now its all that I want, all that I want, all that I want
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But, tonight Im gonna hold you so close
Cuz in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But, tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But, tonight Im gonna hold you so close
Cuz in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But, tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
Oh whoa, (yeah) oh whoa, (yeah) oh whoa (yeah) (yeah)
Oh whoa, (yeah hey) oh whoa, (yeah hey) oh whoa
