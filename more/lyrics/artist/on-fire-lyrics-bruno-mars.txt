Oh (oh) Oh (oh) Ohhhh
Oh (oh) Oh (oh oh)
Keep crawling up touchin' ya', kissin' ya', lovin' ya'
The ice is melting down your back
Cause there's a flame between us
Girl with every single touch
It's like your body strikes a match
I' ma need to
Stop (stop)
Drop (drop)
And roll (roll)
Cause baby girl your heat's out of control
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
My body's a 100 degrees
Every time you're standing next to me
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
Girl you make me so hot
I don't want it to stop, no
Oh, you got me burning up
(oh-oh) burning up
(oh-oh) burning up (oh-oh) oh
So turn it up (oh-oh) turn it up
(oh-oh) some more
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
My temperature is higher
I'm sweating with desire
Feels like I'm on fire
The smoke detector's going off
The neighbour's gonna make the call
The fire trucks are on their way (oh their way, oh!)
Now we're both turning red
We've been up and down the bed
We don't care so we say
I' ma need to
Stop (stop)
Drop (drop)
And roll (roll)
Cause baby girl your heat's (your heat's)
out of (out of) control (control)
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
My body's a 100 degrees (ohhhh)
Every time you're standing next to me
(every time you're standing next to me)
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
Girl you make me so hot (hot)
I don't want it to stop, no (no)
Oh, you got me burning up (oh-oh)
burning up (oh-oh) burning up (oh-oh)
So turn it up (oh-oh) turn it up (oh-oh)
some more
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
My temperature is higher
I'm sweating with desire
Feels like I'm on fire
Girl we got the house burning down
But ain't nobody gonna save us now (oooh)
And I don't care who's knocking on the door
I' ma give you more (more) more (more) more (more)
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
My body's a 100 degrees (ohhhh)
Every time you're standing next to me
(every time you're standing next to me)
Feels like I'm on fire (fire)
Girl you make me so hot (hot)
I don't want it to stop, no
Oh, you got me burning up (oh-oh)

So turn it up (oh-oh) turn it up (oh-oh)
