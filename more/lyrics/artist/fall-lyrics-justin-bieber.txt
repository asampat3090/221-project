Let me tell you a story, about a girl and a boy He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I love you? or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, i'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, of my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel? who forgot how to fly
Did you know that it breaks my heart everytime to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone everytime he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that i'm done with this song that I've figured out
Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, of my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let ya,
You can't fly unless you let yourself,
What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, of my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya,
You can't fly unless you let
Yourself fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, of my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let ya,
Let yourself fall
