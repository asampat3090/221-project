My eyes are so tired
They should sleep
But they won't
They don't
And they won't let me pass this up
My eyes are stuck open in love
They want more of him
They need less of this
They're everything
They're unbelievable
My eyes are lonely and cold
And they're young
And they're old
They're looking for a way out
And a moment to let you in
They want nothing to do with me
And only want to do with him
And they're hungry
I'm warning
And I'm scared
And they won't let me thrive
They'll need everything you own
Make it all so real
By learning to feel
What's not really happening
What's going on is much more
Than I ever hoped for
Ever hoped for
And I'd much rather
Imagine it
Then not live at all
