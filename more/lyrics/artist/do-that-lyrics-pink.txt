I like that though
That's what's up
Some people like the summer when it's hot
Some people like the winter cold
Some people speak their minds when they wanna
And some other people ain't so bold
Whatever it is that you do
You should do you should do with your head held high
So when you're doing you're thing it's cause you wanna
And they never can ask you why
1 I say
Do what you do
Say what you say
Mean what you mean when you say
Cause it's your life
Gotta make your own rules
And you gotta do it, do it your own way
Repeat 1
2 - Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Some like it easy when others they like it rough
But ain't nobody gotta like it but you
Girl, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl, boy, boy
Whatever, you should do what you do
How can they tell you that you could or should?
Would or wouldn't
Well ask 'em can they walk in your shoes
Cause it's your life and you do what you wanna
And remember baby it's all about you
Repeat 1 (2x)
Repeat 2
3 - So if it's on your mind
Then you should speak your piece
And say what'cha say
And if you want it done
Then you should get it done
And do it your way
Repeat 3
Repeat 1 (2x)
Repeat 2 (2x)
Repeat 1 till end
