For those who don't know me
I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way up
24 hours a day 'cause I'm hot like that
Every guy, everywhere
Just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten 'cause I'm built like that
I go through guys like money flyin' out the hands
They try to change me but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you gonna be my man understand
I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't, can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
If there is a question about my intentions
I'll tell ya, I'm not here to sell ya
Or tell you to go to " "
I'm like a puzzle
But all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this
We can make some magic, I'm on like that
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know
I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't, can't,can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake
It's set in my DNA
Don't change me
Don't change me
Don't change me
Don't change me
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back ,I might explode
Baby, by now you should know
I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can't, can't,can't be tamed
I can't be changed
I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
