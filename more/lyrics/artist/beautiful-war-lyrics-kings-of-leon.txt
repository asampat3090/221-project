rock
Bite your tongue
Don't make a scene dear
Everybody's been here
At least once before
But we've been here more
Your heart breaks
Rolls down the window
I've seen it all go
Comeback around
I've heard the sound
The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs
Is doing my head in
I say love
Don't mean nothing
Left them something
Worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war
When I hold
The warmth of your body
There is nobody
That I'd rather hold
Shattered and cold
The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs
Is making me crazy
I say love
Don't mean nothing
Left them something
Worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war
I say love
You don't need nothing
Left them something
Worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
I say love
I say love
Don't need nothing
Left them something,
Worth fighting for
I say love
Don't need nothing
Left them something
Worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
