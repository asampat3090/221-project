There was a time I was one of a kind lost in the world out of me myself and I
Was lonely then like an alien
I tried but I never figured it out
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd
Ooh that was then like an alien
But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
(I'm never alone???)
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travel the night riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong
Ooh That was then like an alien
But the stars in the sky look like home , take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
(I'm never alone???)
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
But the stars in the sky look like home , take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
(I'm never alone???)
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
(Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone)
