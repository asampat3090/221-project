Oh, Ohh
Yeah, ohh
Ooh yeah
(Christmas)
The snow's comin' down
(Christmas)
I'm watchin' it fall
(Christmas)
Lots of people around
(Christmas)
Baby, please come home
(Christmas)
The church bells in town
(Christmas)
Are ringing in song
(Christmas)
Full of happy sounds
(Christmas)
Baby, please come home
They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas)
Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas)
I'm watching them shine
(Christmas)
You should be here with me
(Christmas)
Baby, please come home
They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas)
If there was a way
(Christmas)
I'd hold back this tear
(Christmas)
But it's Christmas day
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
Baby please come home, oh yeah yeah
Christmas
Christmas
Christmas
