Lying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence
Oh well, she's a local girl
No make-up
Cos she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
Is it fast food
I'll regret it after
And I needed money
But I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her I love her
And she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on the radio
It makes me feel naughty
She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, then I'll tell her myself
And we've got love in us
So if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
I say I hate wasps too
I don't really dance
So I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that's alright
I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don't mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What you're wearing
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself
She's like the fast food
I'll regret it after
And I needed money
But I'm too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she's all I need
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself
