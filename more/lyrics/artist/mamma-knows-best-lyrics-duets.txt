Wow there is something going down
Like the storm in the sky
I ain't gonna be played by your behavior
How can I trust someone who's lying to me
So bow out go now I said bow out and leave
I said take your stuff and go
Cuz' you're not for me, no
Mamma knows best when times get hard
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See Mamma knows best when I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my feet on solid ground
See I ain't no old rag doll
That you can pick up and drop
And all of this inconsistent love yeah
I think it's time that it S.T.O stops
So bow out go now I said bow out and leave
I said take your bags and go
Cuz' you're not for me, no
Mamma knows best when times get hard
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See Mamma knows best when I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my feet on solid ground
Just be the best my Daddy said to me
Always use humour as your therapy
Don't ever take life too seriously, (Mamma Mamma, Mamma Mamma)
Just do you cuz' you do you so perfectly (Mamma Mamma, Mamma Mamma)
See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Daddy Daddy knows best
See Mamma Mamma knows...
See Mamma knows best when times get hard
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See Mamma knows best when I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my feet on the ground
See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Daddy Daddy knows best
See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Daddy Daddy knows best
See Mamma Mamma knows best
