When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick, back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick, back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
E-e-everybody know that face
Even with her head low, they still know that shape
When she come through the club people take they place
Chicks throwin' handcuffs 'cause they knowin' they man ain't safe
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin' like, please get low
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick, back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick, back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
E-e-everybody cant do this
Some ain't gotta clue 'til they hear me spit
Ah, chu, I spew 'cause yo girl is sick
Is it the change or the hips you can't tell but you know its thick
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin' like, please get low
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick, back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick, back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
For this type of girl its not that hard
You see her 'cause she's too far gone
They only prayin', pray for her downfall
Why they gotta be so envious?
Doin' what it do fit to be a plus
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Back up, back up
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick, back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick, back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Back it up now
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
