(Anna Kendrick):
I'm limited
Just look at me - I'm limited
And just look at you
You can do all I couldn't do, Glinda
So now it's up to you
For both of us - now it's up to you...
(Kristen Chenoweth):
I've heard it said
That people come into our lives for a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led
To those who help us most to grow
If we let them
And we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you...
Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good
(Anna Kendrick):
It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have re-written mine
By being my friend...
Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a skybird
In a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
(Kristen Chenoweth):
Because I knew you
(Both):
I have been changed for good
(Anna Kendrick):
And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness
For the things I've done you blame me for
(Kristen Chenoweth):
But then, I guess we know
There's blame to share
(Both):
And none of it seems to matter anymore
(Kristen Chenoweth):
Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
(Anna Kendrick):
Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a bird in the wood
(Both):
Who can say if I've been
Changed for the better?
I do believe I have been
Changed for the better
(Kristen Chenoweth):
And because I knew you...
(Anna Kendrick):
Because I knew you...
(Both):
Because I knew you...
I have been changed for good...
