It seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth come
second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got your shades on your eyes and your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time
Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that? (Yeah)
We're paying with love tonight
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the cha-ching, cha-ching about the yah
Ain't about the ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one gettin' tired?
Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now
Guarantee we'll be feelin' alright
Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that? Yeah
We'll pay them with love tonight
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Yeah, yeah, well, keep the price tag and take the cash back
Just give me six strings and a half stack
And you can keep the cars, leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what, in 30 seconds I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaving across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on life
We do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never
Waiting to see in the sign of defeat, uh uh
So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing, it's not about
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the uh cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the yeah ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
