Justice League
It's Da Boss, it gets no better than this
Maybach music
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with two M's in it
This living is so magnificent, stop dreaming it
I'm living it
Oh, I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
I, I can show you, oh, I
I'm tha magnificent with tha sensational style
Far from bein' shallow 'cause she caught me wit a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby, that will take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid
So we back to playin' tennis
We been goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore
So I tried it in aurar
Conscience intervened concentrating on my cream
I'm tha king, make a move, pawns all tha way to queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO which means that I profit off of me
All white T's still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school 'cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin free, I'm chargin' to breathe air
If it's not a Maybach really who da hell cares?
My money long, my nigga, my money strong
If you ain't gettin' money
Dat mean you done somethin' wrong
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with two M's in it in
This living is so magnificent
Stop dreaming it, I'm living life
Oh, I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
I, I can show you, oh, I
I'm tha magnificent with tha sensational style
Down to all of my automobiles wit no miles
Yellow corvettes, black rally stripes
And I never phone ahead
All she do is hear the pipes
Project bitches, upscale kittens
Fuck her for a minute then now we countin' digits
Maybach money, so I always had a vision
I would always tell ma niggas but ain't nobody listened
Words work magic, haters wreak havoc
There ain't nothin' on my back but the delicates of fabrics
I made a transition from the thieves
To the biggest executive, Def Jam's ever seen
Only yours dream, Sean John suit and a S Dot ring
Sean Don for my crew
Bad hoes in pursuit, masspike on a two
Gunplay, he a glue goon wit a attitude
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Go in tha way, two ends away
This livin' is so magnificent
Stop dreaming it, I'm living life
Oh, I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
I, I can show you, oh, I
I'm tha magnificent with tha sensational style
When I decorate a home, marble flooring like Da Nile
Nigga, you a clown, here's the number you should dial
Ye start wit 305 but we end at four pounds
Stop at [Incomprehensible]
Old pound for life is a [Incomprehensible]
All them Carol City killers, feel liking you broke down
Money is a must tommy guns on a bus
Allan Zamren on the case, so you know what you can suck
Wear red all the time but really I'm color blind
Wanna catch my attention, nigga, throw up a dollar sign
One time for tha Crips, young G's buyin' cribs
And I smoke wit Vice Lords when I visit Mississip
The game never change, money still a focal
But it's time to rape tha game like Puffy did Total
Like Rev Run in the tub still smokin'
In memory of Shakir, Boss gotta shout Oakland
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with two M's in it
This living is so magnificent
Stop dreaming it, I'm living life
Oh, I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
I, I can show you, oh, I
