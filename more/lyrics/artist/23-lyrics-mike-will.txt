hiphop
i'm in the club high off purp with some shades on
tatted up , mini skirt with my j's on
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
I be in the club standing on the couch
In them wolf grays like it's my house
Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect
Looking like a model, You just gotta check
I back it up. Cause I don't give a fuck
If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us
I'm MC hammer fly, you can't touch
J's so fly I should work at fight club
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I'm naughty by nature like I'm hip-hop hooray
With my hands in the sky, I wave 'em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I'm 'bout to turn up now
I'm in the club high off purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
I be rockin' J's or
I be rockin' Taylors
I got lots of flavors, my kick game is major
More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan
Smiley, Miley, come swing the thing right by me
Gotta a joint if you wanna get stoned, got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I'm naughty by nature like I'm hip-hop hooray
With my hands in the sky, I wave 'em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I'm 'bout to turn up now
I'm in the club high off purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
I stay showin' out, my kick game is a beast
I got thirty pair of J's that ain't never been released
Flu game twelve, Space Jam 11
On the hype beast sick, they gon' need a paramedic
Turn up, turn up, turn up, I got trippy, I stay live
All this purple in my cup, match them grape 5's
I'm so high, I got three bitches that go bi
I'm so fly, I'm gettin' head like a blow dryer
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I'm naughty by nature like I'm hip-hop hooray
With my hands in the sky, I wave 'em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I'm 'bout to turn up now
I'm in the club high off purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
J's on my feet
So get like me
