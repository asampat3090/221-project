[Liam]
Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while,
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies,
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
[Harry]
Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip,
The music's for the sad man.
[ONE DIRECTION]
Forever young,
I wanna be,
Forever young,
Do you really want to live forever,
Forever,
Forever young.
[Niall]
Some are like water, some are like the heat,
Some are a melody and some are the beat,
But sooner or later they all will be gone,
Why don't they stay young?
[Harry]
It's hard to get old without a cause,
I don't want to perish like a fading horse,
Youth is like diamonds in the sun,
And diamonds are forever.
[One Direction]
Forever young,
I wanna be,
Forever young,
Do you really want to live forever,
Forever,
Or never?
Forever young,
I wanna be,
Forever young (forever),
Do you really want to live forever,
Forever,
Or never?
[Liam]
So many adventures couldn't happen today,
So many songs we forgot to play,
So many dreams swinging out of the blue,
We'll let 'em come true.
[Harry]
Forever young,
I wanna be,
Forever young,
Do you really want to live forever,
Forever,
Or never?
