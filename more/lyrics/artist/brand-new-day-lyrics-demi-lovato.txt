Ohh ohh
Last years old news
I'm breaking out my six string
And playing from my heart
It's not deja vu
Cause it's another summer
That's how this chapter starts
I'm gonna run so fast 'til I can't breathe
Come along and follow me
Let's make some noise we never did before
It's a brand new day
(Don't you see me)
Changing on my way
(So completely)
This time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day
And I'm feelin' good
And I'm feelin' good
So drama free (so drama free)
I'm all about the music
I just wanna sing
Watch me live out my dreams
I'm gonna rock that stage and give my everything
I'm gonna dance until my feet can't move
Come along get in the groove
Let's shine so bright more than we did before
It's a brand new day
(Don't you see me)
Changing on my way
(So completely)
This time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day
And I'm feelin' good!
(What you gonna do? What you gonna do?)
I'm gonna laugh through the summer with you
(Who you gonna be? Who you gonna be?)
You'll just have to watch me carefully
(Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?)
Anywhere my heart wants me to go
I'm gonna sing I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna ride I'm gonna play
I'm gonna try my game in everything
Cause It's a brand new day
(Don't you see me)
Changing on my way
(So completely)
This time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
(It's a brand new day)
Changing on my way
(Changing on my way)
This time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it (gonna hear it)
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit (got the spirit)
It's a brand new day
(It's a brand new day)
It's a brand new day
And I'm feelin' good
Feelin' good
And I'm feelin' good
