I am confident, but I still have my moments
Baby, that's just me
I'm not a supermodel, I still eat Ronalds
Baby, that's just me
Well, some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same
In the La La Land machine, machine.
Who said I can't wear my Converse with my dress?
Well baby, that's just me
Who said I can't be single and have to go out and mingle
Baby, that's not me, no, no
Well, some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same in the La La Land
Tell me do you feel the way I feel
'Cause nothing else is real in the La La Land appeal
Well, some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything, because of where I
Had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same
In the La La Land machine
Well, I'm not gonna change
In the La La Land machine
I will stay the same
In the La La Land Machine
Machine
Machine
I won't change anything in my life
(I won't change anything in my life)
I'm staying myself tonight
(I'm staying myself tonight)
