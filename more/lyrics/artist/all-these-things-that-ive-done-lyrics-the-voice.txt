When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
One more son
If you can hold on
If you can hold on, hold on
I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know, no you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on, in the hearts of men
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no no no no
Help me out, yeah
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
These changes ain't changing me
The cold hearted boy I used to be
Yeah, you know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
(Time, truth, and hearts)
Yeah, you know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down
Over and in, last call for sin
While everyone's lost, the battle is won
With all these things that I've done
All these things that I've done
(Time, truth, and hearts)
If you can hold on
If you can hold on
