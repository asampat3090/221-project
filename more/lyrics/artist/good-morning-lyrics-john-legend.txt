Good morning
Good morning, love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Before you get into the shower
Before you worry about your hair
Baby, give me one more hour
I want you to stay right there
I don't wanna lose a moment
I don't wanna miss a kiss
If I could plan the perfect day, love
Then I would start it just like this
Good morning
Good morning, love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long for morning
Good morning, love
Before we start the day, dear
I'm whispering in your ear
Good morning
Now baby how can I commence you
I'll make it so you can't resist
Whatever else you have to do now
It can't be half as good as this
I'll case you underneath the sheets, love
And I won't let you get away
The day won't be complete, love
Unless we get a chance to say
Good morning
Good morning, love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long for morning
Good morning, love
Before we start the day, dear
I'm whispering in your ear
Good morning
Open your eyes
See my son rise
I feel you're skin
so warm inside
Day breaks so sweet
When you're next to me
So stay each night
So each morning will be
Let's get lost together
I will smile forever
I will smile forever
Was morning
