Today a child is born on earth
(Today a child is born on earth)
Today the glory of God shines everywhere
For all the world
Oh, Jesus born on this day
He is our light and salvation
Oh, Jesus born on this day
He is the King of all nations
Behold the Lamb of God has come
(Behold the Lamb of God has come)
Behold the Savior is born
Sing of His love to everyone
Oh, Jesus born on this day
Heavenly child in a manger
Oh, Jesus born on this day
He is our Lord and our Savior
Today our hearts rejoice in Him
(Today our hearts rejoice in Him)
Today the light of His birth
Fills us with hope and brings peace on earth
Oh, Jesus born on this day
He is our light and salvation
Oh, Jesus born on this day
He is the King of all nations
Today a child is born on earth
(Today a child is born on earth)
He is light, He is love, He is grace
Born on Christmas Day
He is light, He is love, He is grace born on Christmas day
He is light, He is love, He is grace born on Christmas day
He is light, He is love, He is grace born on Christmas day
He is light, He is love, He is grace born on Christmas day
He is light, He is love, He is grace born on Christmas day
