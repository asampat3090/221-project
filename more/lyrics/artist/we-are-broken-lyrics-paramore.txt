Paramore
rock
I am outside
And I've been waiting for the sun
And with my wide eyes
I've seen worlds that don't belong
My mouth is dry
With words I cannot verbalize
Tell me why we live like this
Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me, yeah
'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And oh, the promise we adored?
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole
Lock the doors
'Cause I'd like to capture this voice
That came to me tonight
So everyone will have a choice
And under red lights
I'll show myself it wasn't forged
We're at war, we live like this
Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me
'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And oh, the promise we adored?
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole
Tower over me
Tower over me
And I'll take the truth at any cost
'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And oh, the promise we adored?
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole
