rock
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window
Timber, timber
We're falling down
Let the forest hear our sound
Boom ba boom ba boom
Ah ooo ah ooo
Boom ba boom ba boom
Ah ooo ah ooo
Why can't I see?
What's right in front of me?
We fall
We fall apart
