There ain't no reason you and me should be alone tonight
Yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
I got a reason that you
Who should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's all wrong tonight
Yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
Right on the limb is where we know
We both belong tonight
It's hard to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
Another shot before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final
We call life tonight, alright, alright
Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name
Tonight, alright, alright
It's hard to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
With you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you
With you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you
With you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you
With you, with you, with you, with you
