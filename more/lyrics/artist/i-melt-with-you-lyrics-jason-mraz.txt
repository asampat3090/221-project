Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world thrashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace
I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference and
It's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you
You should know better, dream of better lives
The kind which never hate, you should see why
Dropped in the state of imaginary grace
You should know better, I made a pilgrimage
To save this humans race, you should see why
What I'm comprehending a race that was long gone by
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
You've seen the difference and
It's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
The future's open wide
(The future's open wide)
The future's open wide
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
You've seen the difference and
It's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
You've seen the difference and
It's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world, I'll stop the world
