If you're lost and feel alone
Circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for two
And the way you seem to float
Circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control
With you
Everyone of us is hurt
And everyone of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared
Not you
Your eyes closed
Your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low
Everyone of us is scared
Everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope
For you
