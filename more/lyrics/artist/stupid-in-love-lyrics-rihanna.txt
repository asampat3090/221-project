Stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love
Let me tell you something
Never have I ever
Been a size 10
In my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I
Gave you a chance
To make things right
So I made it
Even though Katy
Told me this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right
Uh
Dont understand it
Blood on your hands
And still you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why
Oh
This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Dont talk to me
Like Im stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
My new nickname
Is you idiot
(Such an idiot)
Thats what my friends
Are calling me when
They see me yelling
Into my
Phone
They tell me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
Guess thats what made me dumb
He don't want it
Not like you want it
Scheming and cheating
Oh girl, why do you
Waste your time
You know he aint right
Telling me this
I don't wanna listen
But you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why
This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Dont talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
Trying to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep
Holding on
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you lost
And you wont realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us
Is really dumb
Ooh
No
No
No
I'm not stupid in love
This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Dont talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid
In love
