Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine
I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging that I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl, loving me is like chewing on pearls
You've got me wandering why
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
You've got me wandering why
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
Won't go without my fix tonight
It's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines
And she can't get enough
I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging that I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl, loving me is like straightening curls
You've got me wandering why
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
You've got me wandering why
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough
I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough
Is it because you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Yes, it's rough
Is it because you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it?
Yes it's rough
You've got me wandering why
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
You've got me wandering why
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
You've got me wandering why
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
You've got me wandering why
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough
