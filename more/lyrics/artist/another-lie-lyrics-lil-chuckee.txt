Tell me what you like, yeah tell me what you don't like
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I'mma make you shine bright like you're laying in the snow
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin and a twirl and
Voice going crazy on this hook like a whirl wind
But then you tell another lie and another lie
Another lie, la la la la
Then you tell another lie and another lie
Another lie, la la la la
Then you tell another lie and another lie
You play with my heart, you think it's exercise
I wanted to still get dome with my younger guys
I knew you needed a nigga home so I sacrificed
You didn't appreciate it, you thought I was supposed to do it anyway
But anyway, I got chicks to do anything
Anything, then talk about a wedding ring
All this yapping 'bout but it ain't seen
Coulda had that big ass in that red Beam
Throwing off what you heard and what you ain't seen
You missed your blessing, you can hurt from that
Give her ass two weeks, she gonna be calling back
Tell me what you like, yeah tell me what you don't like
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I'mma make you shine bright like you're laying in the snow
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin and a twirl and
Voice going crazy on this hook like a whirl wind
Damn, bitch consistent, how you do that shit?
I mean really, I wanna know, I'm really new to this
How you just keep lying, lying, lying with a straight face
Fucking him on the weekdays and carry on like a briefcase
You a pro at this shit, who taught you that? Your momma, huh?
She told you that it's MOM, just get the comma time
She told you Avon Masters wants some ass so why you here to ask
You might as well get some cash, I understand, that's the fucking game
I ain't gonna lie, you made me a believer, she probably even had the fever for Bieber
All I had to do is sit back, wider receiver
She go for any nigga balling, sideline cheerleader
And I know, I know how this shit go
This is familiar, I done seen it before
Baby keep on lying, that shit ain't flying
Girl, you selling bullshit and I ain't buying
Tell me what you like, yeah tell me what you don't like
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I'mma make you shine bright like you're laying in the snow
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin and a twirl and
Voice going crazy on this hook like a whirl wind
Tell me what you like, yeah tell me what you don't like
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I'mma make you shine bright like you're laying in the snow
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin and a twirl and
Voice going crazy on this hook like a whirl wind
