I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock
Word on the street, you got something to show me me
Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery
I'm intrigued for a peek, heard it's fascinating
Come on, baby, let me see what you're hiding underneath
Words up your sleeve, such a tease, wanna see the show
In 3D, a movie, heard it's beautiful
Be the judge and my girls gonna take a vote
Come on, baby, let me see what you're hiding underneath
I want the jaw dropping eye popping, head turning, body shocking
Oh, ay, oh, oh, oh, ay, oh
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking, show stopping amazing
Oh, ay, oh, oh, oh, ay, oh
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a beeotch
I'ma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
Come on, baby, let me see what you're hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kinda guy, I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see what you're hiding underneath
Peacock, cock, cock, your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock, I wanna see your
Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk
Break me off, if you bad, show me who's the boss
Need some goose, take it loose, come on take a shot
Come on, baby, let me see what you're hiding underneath
I want the jaw dropping eye popping, head turning, body shocking
Oh, ay, oh, oh, oh, ay, oh
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking, show stopping amazing
Oh, ay, oh, oh, oh, ay, oh
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a beeotch
I'ma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
Come on, baby, let me see what you're hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kinda guy, I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see what you're hiding underneath
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock, cock
Oh my God, no exaggeration
Boy, all this time was worth the waiting
I just shed a tear
I am so unprepared
You've got the finest architecture
End of the rainbow looking treasure
Such a sight to see
And it's all for me
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a beeotch
I'ma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
Come on, baby, let me see what you're hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kinda guy, I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock, cock
Wanna see your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock, your peacock, cock
Wanna see your
Come on, baby, let me see what you're hiding underneath
