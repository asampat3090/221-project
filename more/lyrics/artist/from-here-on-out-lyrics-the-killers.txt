rock
Little birdie whispered in my ear,
You been cooking up a world of fear,
Put your hands in things.
You should have known,
You was riding in the danger zone.
Well you had us all fooled with your quarter back smile,
And your crocodile tears there for a while,
My paradigm shifting man you're making me shout:
Hey, from here on out,
Friends are gonna be hard to come by,
Left us wondering what it all was about,
You had it easy man you chose the hard way,
Walk that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt,
From here on out.
Should I pass over, decide to cross?
You may wonder what the trouble costs,
That don't matter now life goes on.
Hallelujah the trouble's gone,
No sense in holding grudges and its best to forgive,
These are things that I must learn to practice while I live,
Got my paradigm shifting man you're making me shout:
Hey, from here on out,
Friends are gonna be hard to come by,
Left us wondering what was it was all about,
You had it easy man chose the hard way,
Walk that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt.
Hey, from here on out,
Let the bugle blow a song of peace time,
Left us wondering what it's all about,
You been denied but you carried it with ya,
Down that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt,
Yeah from here on out.
