Pink
pop
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hangin' on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been cryin', I've been cryin'
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryin' to hold, tryin' to hold
But there's nothing to grasp
So I let go
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
I won't miss all of the fighting
That we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say "there is nothing left"
No more sick whiskey dick
No more battles from me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home
I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You've had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss
I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, All the lies
Will all be crystal clear
I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You've had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You've had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
