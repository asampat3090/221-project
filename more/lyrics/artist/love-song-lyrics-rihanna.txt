Give it to me on a daily

Boy lately you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering I'm wondering
If I'm on your mind
Boy I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want
So come express it

Can you love me for poor

And when I love you close
You can feel my heart
Beating through my clothes
