There's always somebody taller with more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he's fit
And you just can't measure up, no, you don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her, when she was there
They've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you're better off without her anyway
You said, you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I know you were though
Now you don't know what she's up to, you can only assume
If she's not out front of the shops then, they've gone to his room
Bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that's what he likes
I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice
But she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
She's looking at ya funny, rarely looking at ya twice
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you're better off without her anyway
You said, you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but it's clear you were though
You hear what she has been doing, never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gate at twenty past three
She's been with all of the boys but never went very far
And she wagged English and Science just to go in his car
They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched me bird and he'd probably kick my head in, oh
Now the girls have grown yeah, but I'm sure that
They still carry on in similar ways
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, I'm better off without her anyway
I said, I wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I'm only pretending you know
Yeah I'm only pretending you know
I was only pretending you know
I was only pretending you know, oh
