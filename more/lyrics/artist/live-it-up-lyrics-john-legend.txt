You know we've been struggling for such a long time
Working here and there just to get by
It's finally time for me to get mine
No more robbing Peter so we can pay Paul
(Oh no)
Or going to mama's house to make a phone call
(No no)
No we don't have to struggle at all
'Cause now everyday is feeling like Friday
(Friday)
I'm getting paid and doing it my way
(My way)
We're finally on our way
Baby now it's time to celebrate
Oh live it up we can go crazy
Live it up you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
We're flying high don't wanna come down
We'll let 'em know all over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up
No more putting it in the layaway
'Cause boo I got the money today
Come on and go to the mall and let's play
Let's go raise a toast to the days ahead
You can't take it with you when you're dead
You might as well enjoy it now instead
Oh now, it's about to be a long evening
(Yeah yeah)
We'll party through the rest of the weekend
(Come on)
We're finally on our way
Baby now it's time to celebrate
Oh live it up we can go crazy
Live it up you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
(Oh we're flying high)
We're flying high don't wanna come down
We'll let 'em know all over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up
We can fly so high in the moonlit sky
'Cause there's no more cloudy days
It's so beautiful when you feel the flow
We can dance the night away
Do you remember when times were hard
Oh so hard, through it all
We've come so far
So we gotta live it up
So we can just celebrate there's no more pain
Raise your glass and feel no shame
Oh so we gotta live it up
Oh live it up we can go crazy
Live it up you and me baby
Live it up, live it up, live it up
(Oh we're flying high)
We're flying high don't wanna come down
(Yeah yeah)
We'll let 'em know all over town and
Live it up, live it up, live it up
Oh it's time to celebrate baby
So we don't have to worry no more
We don't have to struggle no more
So does it feel good to you?
I know it feels good to you
We don't have worry no more
We don't have to struggle no more
It's time to celebrate baby
Yeah, we gotta live it up
