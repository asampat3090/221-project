I made Her Say
Hold up(Yea), Born In 88(Word)
How Old Is That(Damn)
Old Enough
I Got Seniority, With The Sorority
So, That Explains Why I Love College
Getting Brain In The Library Cause I Love Knowledge
When You Used Your Medulla Oblongata
And Give Me Scoliosis Until I Comatosest
And Do While I'm Sleep, Yeah A Lil Osmosis
And That's My Commandment, You Ain't Gotta Ask Moses
More Champagne, More Toastest
More Damn Planes, More Coastest
And Fuck A Bus, The Benz Is Parked Like Rosa

She Said She Want Whatever She Like
But You Gotta Bring Your Friend
And We Can Have One Hell Of A Night
Through The Day
She Blamed It On The Al-A-A-Al-A-Alcohol
She Had Her Hair Did, It Was Bound To Fall
Down Down For A Damn, Cudi Already Said It
Her Poker Face Book I'd already read it
But Man Her Head Was Gooder Than A Music
Electro Body, Known To Blow Fuses
A Stripper From The South
Lookin For A Payday
Said, Bitch You Should Do It For The Love Like Ray-J
But They Say You Be On The Conscious Tip
Get Your Head Right And Get Up On This Conscious Dick
I Embody Everything From The Godly To The Party
Its The Way I Was Raised On The Southside Safari
So
