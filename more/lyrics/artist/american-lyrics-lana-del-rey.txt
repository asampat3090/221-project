Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your Crystal Method on
You were like, tall, tan, drivin' 'round the city
Flirtin' with the girls like, "You're so pretty"
"Springsteen is the king, don't you think?"
I was like, "Hell yeah, that guy can sing"
Like ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-oh
You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin's so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
L.A., I don't even have to fake it now
You were like so sick, everybody said it
You were way ahead of the trend, ge-get it
Elvis is the best, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Like ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-oh
You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin's so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Everybody wants to go fast
But they can't compare
I don't really want the rest
Only you can take me there
I don't even know what I'm saying
But I'm praying for you
You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin's so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Like an American
