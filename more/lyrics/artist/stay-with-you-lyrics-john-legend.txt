We've been together for a while now we're growing stronger everyday now
It feels so good and there is no doubt I will stay with you
As each morning brings sunrise and the flowers bloom in springtime
On my lovin' you can rely and I'll stay with you
Oh I'll stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I'll stay with you when no one else is around
When the dark clouds arrive I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright I will stay with you
Though relationships can get old have a tendency to grow cold
We have something like miracle yeah, and I'll stay with you
Oh I'll stay with you through the ups and the downs
Yes I'll stay with you when no one else is around
When the dark clouds arrive I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright I will stay with you
There will be heartaches and pains
Yes it will but through it all, we will remain, hey
In this life, we all know friends may come, and they may go
Through the years I know I will stay
In the end I know that we'll find love so beautiful and divine
And we'll be lovers for lifetime, yeah and I'll stay with you
Oh I will stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I'll stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright I will stay with you
Yeahh everything will be fine yeah and I will stay with you
Through the end of time I will stay with you
