Paramore
rock
I settle down a twisted up frown
Disguised as a smile, well, you would have never known
I had it all, but not what I wanted
'Cause hope for me was a place uncharted and overgrown
You'd make your way in
I'd resist you just like this
You can't tell me to feel
The truth never set me free
So I did it myself
You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More, more, more, more
Open your eyes like I open mine
It's only the real world, life you will never know
Shifting your way to throw off the pain
Well, you can ignore it, but only for so long
You look like I did
You resist me just like this
You can't tell me to heal
And it hurts remembering
How it felt to shut down
Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More, more, more, more
The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
So I'll do it myself
You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out
Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
You won't come any closer
You've got to reach out more
More, more, more, more
