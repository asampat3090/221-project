Head down as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
I should, I find myself in love racing the earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run, run, smash into you
I wanna run, run, smash into you
It flows, what I hear no one else has to know
'Cause I know in what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run, run, smash into you
I wanna run, run, smash into you, smash into you
Head down, as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
I should, I'm in love and I'm racing the earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
Oh, I wanna run, smash into you
I'm willing to run, smash into you
I'm willing to run and run, and run, and run, ooh
I'm ready to run and run, and run, and run, ooh
And I wanna run, run, smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, smash into you
