I paid all my dues and she wanted to know
That I'd never leave her now I'm ready to go
As strange as it seems, she's endless to me
She's just like paperwork but harder to read
Patience's my enemy, loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I made all my plans and as she has made hers
She kept me in mind but I wasn't sure
I searched every room for a way to escape
But every time I try to leave she keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way
Patience's my enemy, loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
And like the back of her hand she already understands everything
"Won't you stay?", she says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands I'll stay, anyway
'Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself, I know myself
I know myself
