Pitbull
pop
Hee's baaacckk!!
To rip on this track, I'll rip any broad
I don't care, white or black!
Hee's baaacckk!
If Pit's on da job, then there's no need to worry
Dog just hurry up and wait,
'cause I aint Going no where anytime soon
Sick what these rappers wanna be?
That's me, times 2
Now
Get ready for me to take over this game
I'm cutting da flow, like I'm cutting da cane
Things will never be da same
Pause
There's a lick for 50 bricks
Now pause
And think about it
Then pause
Is it really worth it?
Then pause pause
FUCK YEAH!!!
I'm ready to go, jump in da ride
Get da mask, get da gloves
Cut off da lights, pop da gat
Run inside, fire'em up or tie'em up
But don't forget to pick up da prize
And upgrade the ??
If they don't give up da pies
Now
I would hate to have to calm these boys down
'cause to be honest I can't, so Pal
Why don't you just give us da keys and pounds
Now Guess What He Said?
[Chorus 2x]
Ya'll want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!
Ya'll want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!
Ya'll want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!
Ya'll hurry up and wait! Ya'll hurry up and wait!
I've been brought up,
By street cats who didn't get caught up
Like that New Jack Nino Brown at da Carter
I'm da new Tony Montana, only I'm just a
Little bit smarter!
