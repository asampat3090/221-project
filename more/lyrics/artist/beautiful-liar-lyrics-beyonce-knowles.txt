Ay! Ay!
(Nobody likes being played)
Ay!
Oh, Beyonce, Beyonce
Oh, Shakira, Shakira
(Hey!)
He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about him that you wouldn't want to read about
He kissed me, he's a one and only beautiful liar
(Yes!)
Tell me how you tolerate the things I just found out about
We'll never know, why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry
Ay! Lets not kill the karma
Ay! Lets not start a fight
Ay! Its not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Oh! Can't we laugh about it?
(Ha ha ha)
Oh! It's not worth our time
Oh! We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar
I trusted him but when I followed you I saw you together
I didn't know about you then 'til I saw you with him when, yeah
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong?
We'll never know when the pain and heartbreaks over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone!
Ay! Lets not kill the karma
Ay! Lets not start a fight
Ay! Its not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Oh! Can't we laugh about it?
(Ha ha ha)
Oh! It's not worth our time
Oh! We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar
Tell me how to forgive you when it's me who's ashamed
And I wish I could free you of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple, he's the one to blame!
Hey!
Ay! Beyonce, Beyonce
Ay! Shakira, Shakira
Oh! Beyonce, Beyonce
Oh! Shakira, Shakira
(Hey!)
Ay! Lets not kill the karma
Ay! Lets not start a fight
Ay! Its not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Oh! Can't we laugh about it?
(Ha ha ha)
Oh! It's not worth our time
Oh! We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar
