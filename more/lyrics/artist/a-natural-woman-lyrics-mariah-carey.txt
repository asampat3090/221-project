--- Written by King, Goffin, and Wexler
Looking out on the morning sex
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to shit another day
Lord it make me feel so tired
Before the day I met you life was so unkind
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Oh baby watcha done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
You make me feel so alive
And you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
And you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
And you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
