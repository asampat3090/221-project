pop
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da, da da
Da da da, da da
I don't know if I can yell any louder
How many time I've kicked you outta here?
Or said something insulting?
Da da da, da da
I can be so mean when I wanna be
I am capable of really anything
I can cut you into pieces
When my heart is broken
Da da da, da da
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me
How did I become so obnoxious?
What is it with you that makes me act like this?
I've never been this nasty
Da da da, da da
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest
But baby I don't mean it
I mean it, I promise
Da da da, da da
Please don't leave me
Oh please don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me
I forgot to say out loud how beautiful you really are to me
I cannot be without, you're my perfect little punching bag
And I need you, I'm sorry
Da da da, da da
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da, da da
Please, please don't leave me
(Da da da, da da)
Baby please don't leave me
(Da da da, da da)
No, don't leave me
Please don't leave me no no no
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me, oh no no no.
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please don't leave me
Baby, please, please don't leave me
