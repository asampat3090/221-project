This is what I look like today
And I'm trying not to pull out my hair
I'm trying hard to grow it
'but I'm far too shy to show it back there
That's probably why I like wearing hats
There's no denying, I'm deferring the facts
Avoiding confrontation
Lacks tact in a situation
Behind every line is a lesson yet to learn
But if you ask me
The feeling that I'm feeling is overwhelming
And oh, it goes to show
There's so much to know
I wrote this for my prettiest friend
But while trying not to prove that I care
I was trying not to make
All my moves in one motion and scare her away
She can't see she's making me crazy now
I don't believe she knows she's amazing how
She has me holding my breathe
So I'd never guess that I'm a none such unsuitable, suited for her
But if you ask me
The feeling that I'm feeling is complimentary
And oh, it goes to show
The moral of the story is boy loves girl
And so, but the way that it unfolds is yet to be told
I know that I should be brave
Even pretty can be seen by the blind
I know that I cannot wait
Until the day we finally learn how to find each other
Redefining open minds
And if you ask me
The feeling that I'm feeling is overjoyed
And it's golden, it goes to show then
The ending of this song should be left alone
And so on, 'cause the way it unfolds is yet to be told
