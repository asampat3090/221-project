Lorde
alternative
All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, oh whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this
It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scale without thinking of size
I was fighting off every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me but
I've learned not to want the quiet of the room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go
Oh whoa
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, ohh
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this
It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
Its a marathon run
Or a mountain you scale without thinking of size
I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me but
I've learned not to want the quiet of the room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go
Oh whoa
