Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... [3x]
We had the best years of our lives,
But you and I would never be the same,
September took me by surprise,
And I was left to watch the seasons change.
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... [3x]
It's been so quiet since you're gone,
And everyday feels more like a year,
Sometimes I wish I could move on,
The memories would all just disappear.
So many things I should've,
Said when I had the chance,
So many times we took it all for granted.
[CHORUS]
I'd never thought this could ever end,
I'd never thought I'd lose my bestfriend,
Everything is different now,
Can we stop the world from turning?
I'd never thought I'd have to let you go,
I'd Never thought I'd ever feel this low,
I Wish I could go back,
And we'd stop the world from turning.
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... [2x]
Looking back on better days,
When we were young, we thought we knew so much.
And now it seems so far away,
I'm wondering If I was good enough.
So many things I should've,
Said when I had the chance,
So many times we took it all for granted.
[CHORUS]
I'd never thought we would ever end,
I'd never thought I'd lose my bestfriend,
Everything is different now,
Can we stop the world from turning?
I'd never thought I'd have to let you go,
I'd Never thought I'd ever feel this low,
I Wish I could go back,
And we'd stop the world from turning.
Gone are all the days,
When we swore we'd never break,
And now I'm left here alone.
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... [3x]
Oh oh ooo..
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo...
I'd never thought this would ever end,
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo...
I'd never thought I'd lose my bestfriend,
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo...
Everything is different now,
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo...
Can we stop the world from turning?
[CHORUS]
I'd never thought this could ever end,
I'd never thought I'd lose my bestfriend,
Everything is different now,
Can we stop the world from turning?
I'd never thought I'd have to let you go,
I'd Never thought I'd ever feel this low,
I Wish I could go back,
And we'd stop the world from turning.
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo... [2x]
Oh oh oo ooo.
