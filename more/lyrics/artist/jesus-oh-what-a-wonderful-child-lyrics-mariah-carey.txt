Jesus, Jesus
Oh what a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
New life, new hope, new joy He brings
Won't you listen to the angels sing
Glory, glory, glory
To the new born King
Jesus, Jesus
Oh what a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
New life, new hope, new joy He brings
Won't you listen to the angels sing
Glory, glory, glory
To the new born King
He was herald by the angels
Born in a lowly manger
The virgin Mary was His mother
And Joseph was his earthly father
Three wise men came from afar
They were guided by a shining star
To see King Jesus where He lay
In a manger filled with hay
Jesus, Jesus
Oh what a wonderful child
Jesus, Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
Oh new joy He brings
Won't you listen to the angels sing
Glory
To the new born King
Oh Jesus
