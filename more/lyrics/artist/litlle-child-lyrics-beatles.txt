Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby, take a chance with me
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby, take a chance with me
If you want someone to make you feel so fine
Then we'll have some fun when you're mine all mine
So come on, come on, come on
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby, take a chance with me, whoa yeah
When you're by my side you're the only one
Don't you run and hide, just come on, come on
Yeah, come on, come on, come on
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby, take a chance with me, oh yeah
Baby, take a chance with me, oh yeah
Baby, take a chance with me, oh yeah
Baby, take a chance with me, oh yeah
