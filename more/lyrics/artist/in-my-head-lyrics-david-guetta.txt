Is everybody broken hearted?
We are living in a clouded dreams
A skyscraper seems so tall
But no one fights, no one learns
We just push until it burns
No, I cant understand
Tell me Im mad cause in my head
We work you out
You dont mess around
And the storms do come out
Cause in my head
Nothings too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up
In my head
Cause in my head
Nothings too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up
In my head
In my head
So is this it? What you wanted
Im knowing it but just turn it around
Cause no matter what I try
I tried it..
In my head
Nothings too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up
In my head
In my head
In my head
In my head
In my head
Nothings too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up
Its in my head
In my head
Go!
Cause in my head
Nothings too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up
In my head
