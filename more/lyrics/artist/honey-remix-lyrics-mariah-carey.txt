Ooh ooh, honey, got me hooked on you
I like that, come on, M.C., come on, M.C.
I like that, let's go
Honey, you can have me when you want me
If you just simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one who makes me come running
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey
It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day, I can't hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
I can't be elusive with you honey
'Cause it's blatant that I've feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey
It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day, I can't hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
I love every little thing you do
Ooh ooh, honey, got me hooked on you
It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day, I can't hardly wait for another taste of honey
It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day, I can't hardly wait for another taste of honey
It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day, I can't hardly wait for another taste of honey
