With you, with you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they could never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had the hide like
We do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
There might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall
But we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was a destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I got you, baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause in a way it's gonna end right
But we are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
There might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall
But we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like just because this cold, cold world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to decide we
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place, oh, no, no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
