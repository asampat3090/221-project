(Chorus) (Nelly Furtado)
Im alive i can feel the blood rushing thru my veins an thats all i need
know 'cause im not looking for a change.'cause i got friends and enemies
but it just dont bother me, 'cause as long as i believe i can breath.

moon the Sorceress, Swollen Members an my girl NF, the predators
and the terminators the tribe cold breath why we hurt em later we
do so much damage now. they'll truck em, when i hit them, so much
garbage around yells, bells and whistles like carnival sounds

(Chorus)
Im alive i can feel the blood rushing thru my veins an thats all i need

but it just dont bother me, 'cause as long as i believe i can breath.
