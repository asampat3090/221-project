It's so sweet
In my daydreams
Every night you creep into my dreams
Fantasy
It's so deep but it's a fantasy
Every night you creep into my dream
It's so real
(In my daydreams)
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet
(In my daydreams)
It seems so real
You touch me
You come into my room
Come to me
It's just a fantasy
It feels so sweet
But it's just not real
Oh baby, it's just a sweet fantasy
And daydream is all that I can do
I feel raptured over you
In silence, I keep it to myself
Come take me
I don't want nobody else
And it's sweet
I feel sweet
And it's sweet
I feel sweet
And it's sweet
I feel sweet
And it's deep
I feel really deep
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet
You're like the kiss of life
You're like the kiss of life
Beaming in the sky
Oh you're just a fantasy
Oh baby, you come into my room
Yeah, but you're just a fantasy
