Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumors spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did, what you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
'Cause baby, I didn't
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
That should be me
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you use that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?
Whatcha doing to me?
You're taken' him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working 'cause you know
That, that should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that should be me
I need to know should I fight for our love or disarm?
It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart, ooh
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me, ooh
Holding your hand, that should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby
Oh, that should be me, yeah
That should be me, giving you flowers
That should be me, talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me
Never should've let you go
I never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
That should be me
Never should've let you go
Never should've let you go
That should be me
