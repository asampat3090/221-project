O come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant
Oh come ye O come ye to Bethlehem;
come and behold him born the King of angels;
O come let us adore him Christ the Lord.
God of God light of light
lo he abhors not the virgin's womb;
very God begotten not created:
O come let us adore him Christ the Lord.
Sing choirs of angels sing in exultation
sing all ye citizens of heaven above;
glory to God in the highest:
O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.
See how the shepards summoned to his cradel,
leaving their flocks, draw nigh with lowly fear;
we too will thither hend our joyful footsteps;
O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.
Yea, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy morning;
Jesus, to thee be glory given;
word of the Father, now in flesh appearing:
O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.
