Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O' the fields we go
Laughing all the way. (Hahaha)
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright.
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight.
Chorus:
Oh Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun
it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh Hey!
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what joy it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss FannyBright
Seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Miss fortuned seemed his lot
He got into a drifited bank
And we we got upsot
{chorus}
A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell
A gent was riding by
In a one horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lied
But quickly drove away
{chorus}
Now the ground is white
Go it while your young
Take the girls to night
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bobtailed bay
To forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack you'll take the lead
