Brian, top marks for not tryin'
So kind of you to bless us
With your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder, are you puttin' us under
Cause we can't take our eyes off
The t-shirt and ties combination
Well see you later, innovator
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
Cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
She'll be sayin' "Use me,
Show me the jacuzzi"
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your rendezvous rate means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm
(Brian)
Calm, collected, and commandin'
(Top marks for not tryin')
You made the other stories standin'
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept cause
You've stolen their thunder
Are you puttin' us under?
Cause we can't take our eyes off
The t-shirt and ties combination
Well see you later, innovator
