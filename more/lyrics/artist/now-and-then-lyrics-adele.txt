Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad
It cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry
How I'm still trying to stay inside
Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain
'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
You know when to make me, I might just your heal
You know when to make me, I might just your heal
You know when to make me, I might just your heal
You know when to make me, I might just your heal
