rock
Get back on track, pick me up some bottles of booze
Fickle freshman probably thinks he's cooler than you
A hay ride, a fire, everybody's coming around
So go press your skirt, word is there's a new girl in town
I call shotgun, you can play your R 'n' B tunes
The fellowship time, it always comes a little too soon
The land of the creeps freshened up and baby faced shaved
Put your eyes on me and I know a place where we can get away
Just say I want you, just exactly like I used to
'Cause baby this is only bringing me down
Homeboy's so proud, he finally got the video proof
The night vision show she was only ducking the truth
It's heavy I know, the black eye with the gift down below
A choke and a gag, she spit up and came back for more
And said I want you just exactly like I used to
And baby this is only bringing me down
She said I want you
I want you just exactly like I used to
And baby this is only bringing me down
I said I want you just exactly like I used to
And baby this is only bringing me down
