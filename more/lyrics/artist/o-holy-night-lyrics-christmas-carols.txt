O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt
its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and
glorious morn.
Fall on your knees O hear the
angels voices.
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night divine
O night divine.
