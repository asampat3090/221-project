Will you recognise me, in the flashing lights
I try to keep my heart beat, but I can't get it right
Will you recognise me, when I'm laying on my back
Something's gone inside me, and it 'aint coming back, now
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now
But the day, it always lasts too long, mm, then I'm gone
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now
But the day, it always lasts too long, woah
Then I'm gone (x7) woo woo woo wooo
Will you recognise me, when I'm stealing from the poor
You're not gonna' like me, no I'm nothing like before, wow
And will you recognise me, when I lose another friend
Will you learn to leave me, or give me one more try again
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now
But the day, it always lasts too long, woah, then I'm gone
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now
But the day, it always lasts too long, now
Then I'm gone (x7) now woo woo woo wooo
Baby be mine, now, mm, mm, mmm
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now
But the day, it always lasts too long, mm, then I'm gone
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now
But the day, it always lasts too long, wow
Then I'm gone (x19)
Baby be mine, oh, woah, wow
