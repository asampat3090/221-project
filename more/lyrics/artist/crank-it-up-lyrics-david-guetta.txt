She's the keys to my starter in my automatic car
Yeah she make me wanna go harder and she always lift the bar
When she keep that spotlight glowing 'cause she is a superstar
Everybody knows this girl when she step up in the place whether near or far
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She's the only girl left in the world that can guarantee
What you need tonight
With my Gs and we riding in a magnificent car
And we rolling with the baddest chicks and you won't see a flaw
Booty riding up so perfect, badder than my Audemars
Gonna pound it up so perfect that can get until tomorrow
Watch her crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She's the only girl left in the world that can guarantee
What you need tonight
With my Gs and we riding in a magnificent car
And we rolling with the baddest chicks and you won't see a flaw
Booty riding up so perfect, badder than my Audemars
Gonna pound it up so perfect that can get until tomorrow
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
She's trying to make me fall in love again, yeah
The way she moving I can tell you she's almost there, yeah
She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She's the only girl left in the world that can guarantee
What you need tonight
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she crank it up
The way she cranks it up
