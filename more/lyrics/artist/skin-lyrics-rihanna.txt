[Verse 1:]
The mood is set,
So you already know what's next.
TV on blast,
Turn it down,
Turn it down.
Don't want it to clash,
With my body screaming out.
I know you hearin' it,
You got me moaning now.
I got a secret that I wanna show you, oh.
I got a secret so imma drop em to the floor, oh.
[Hook:]
No teasin,
You waited long enough.
Go deep,
Imma throw it at ya,
Can you catch it?
Don't hold back,
You know I like it rough.
Know I'm feelin ya, huh.
Know you liking it, huh.
[Chorus:]
So why you standing over there with ya clothes on,
Baby strip down for me,
Go on take em off.
Don't worry baby,
Imma meet you half way,
Cause I know you wanna see me.
[Verse 2:]
Almost there,
So baby don't stop what you're doing.
Softer than a mutha
Boy I know you wanna touch.
Breathing down my neck,
I can tell ya wanna -
And now you want it like,
Want you to feel it now.
I got a secret that I wanna show you, ou.
I got a secret Imma drop em to the floor, ou.
[Hook:]

[Chorus 2:]
No heels,

All I'm in is just skin.

Wanna feel your skin.

[Bridge:]
All in baby,
Don't hold nothing back.
Wanna take control,
Ain't nothing wrong with that.
Say you liking how I feel,
Ain't gotta tell me that.
Just put your skin baby on my skin.
[Chorus 2:]
No heels,
No shirt,

Wanna feel your skin.
You a beast, oh.
You know that I like that.
Come on baby,
