It doesn't matter where you been
Or what you did wrong
It doesn't matter who you are
You're always welcome
It only matters that your heart believes
And you confess
If you committed any sin you'll be forgiven
Callin on all of God's children
Time to come home
If you wanna be delivered
Time to come home
I've been rescued by the savior
Time to come home
If you wanna be in His favor
Time to come home
Come on home
Come on come on home
oooh yeah yeah
come on home
If you cant see your way out
And you're drowning in your regrets
If you have everything you want
But you still cant find happiness
'cause when you feel like you're forsaken
Life can be so hopeless
Maybe you need to come home
So your life can be planned
Oooh
God's children
Time to come home
If you wanna be delivered
Time to come home
I've been rescued by the savior
Time to come home
If you wanna be
you need to be
Time to come home
Don't bare the burden all by yourself
(By yourself)
The Redeemer's here He's gonna give you help
(Give you help)
Come unto him and he will give you rest
For any heart that's heavy laden for salvation
ooh
Calling all God's children
Time to come home
If you wanna be delivered
Time to come home
I've been rescued by the savior
Time to come home
If you wanna be in his favor
Time to come home
My home
Your home
In his everlasting arms
My home
Your home
In his everlasting arms
Don't you know its time to come home
Time to come home
Deliver me
I've been rescued by the savior
Dont you wanna be in his favor
Yeah
My home
Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home
Your home
In His everlasting arms
If you wanna be in his favor
My home
Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home
Your home
In His everlasting arms
Time to come home
