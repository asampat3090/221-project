Ohhh...

Ohhh...
Where are you now
When I need you the most
Why don't you take my hand
I wanna be close
Help me when I am down
Lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong
Take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free
Yeah
Where are you now
Where are you now
Now that im half grown
Why are we far apart
I feel so alone
Where are you now
When nothing is going right
Where are you now
I can't see the light
So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah, yeah
I need you, to need me
Cant you see me
How could you leave me
My heart is
Half empty
Im not whole
When your not with me
I want you
You with me
To guide me, hold me, love me now
Where are you now
Woahhh...
Where are you now
So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah, yeah
Ohhh...
Where are you now
Oh...
Yeah, yeah...
Ohh, ohh...
Yeah...
