Beatles
rock
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy!
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It'easy!
Nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you were meant to be
It'easy!
All you need is Love
Love is all you need.
