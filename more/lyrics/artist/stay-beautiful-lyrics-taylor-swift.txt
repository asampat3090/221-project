Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he's walking home
Saying, does he know
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know, you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful
Corey finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures with my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say
'Hey, by the way'
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know, you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know, you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay beautiful
A beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful
A beautiful, beautiful?
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
