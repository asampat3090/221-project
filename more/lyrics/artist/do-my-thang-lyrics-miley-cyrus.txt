Every single night and every single day
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing
So don't you worry about me I'll be okay
I'mma do my thing, 'cause I'mma do my thing
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my thing,
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my
I'mma do my thing

Bang bang
I'mma shoot 'em down baby
Look at me, I'm high up off the ground baby
Oh shoot, pass that shit around baby
That s*** true, but I don't hear a sound
I'm a southern belle crazier than hell
Getting wild up in here
Getting live up in here
Burning up up in here
Turnt up up in here
We tear the roof up now we up out of here
We do it, we do it
We don't give a f***
Only thing we think about is turning up, turning up
We do it, we do it
We do it all the way
Alive so everybody hands to the sky 'cause
Every single night and every single day
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing
So don't you worry about me I'll be okay
I'mma do my thing, 'cause I'mma do my thing
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my thing,
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my
I'mma do my thing
I'mma do my thing

Bang b****
You think I'm strange b****
It's bananas like a fucking 'rangatang b****
Don't worry 'bout me
I got it all arranged b****
Mind your business, stay in your lane b****
Oh yeah I'm a southern belle
I told ya'll once before I get crazier than hell
Get wild up in here
Get live up in here
Turnt up up in here
Burning up up in here
We do it, we do it
We don't give a f***
Only thing we think about is turning up, turning up
We do it, we do it
We do it all the way
Alive so everybody hands to the sky 'cause
Every single night and every single day
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing
So don't you worry about me I'll be okay
I'mma do my thing, 'cause I'mma do my thing
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my thing
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my
