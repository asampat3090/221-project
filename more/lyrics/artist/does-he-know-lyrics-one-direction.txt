Liam:
He knows about you in every way
He's memorized every part of your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
Yeah, he knows everything there is to know
Harry:
Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
Your favorite band, the way that you dance
But baby, baby
All:
Does he know you can move it like that?
Woah-oh
Does he know your out and I want you so bad
Woah-oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back?, oh
Does he know?
Liam:
I catch your eye then you turn away
But there's no hiding the smile on your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
He's not around, girl, you let me know

All the little things that who make you who you are
