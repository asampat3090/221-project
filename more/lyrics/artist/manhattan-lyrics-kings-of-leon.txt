rock
I like to dance all night, summons the day
But that's how I play, yeah that's how I play
I said who are you? Don't matter who you are
So we dance all night and dance all day
I say, I say
We're gonna fuel the fire, gonna stoke it up
We're gonna sip this wine and pass the cup
Who needs avenues, who needs reservoirs
Gonna show this town how to kiss these stars
I say, I say
We're gonna hunt to kill, gonna skin the hide
A yelp and scream and away I ride
And every drop that spills on every plot of ground
It's all for you for what you found
I say, I say
I say, I say
It's gonna take your hand
And gonna drive you home
It's gonna keep on, keep on, keep on
And then forever roam
