Yea they wanna be loved
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
They wanna be loved
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I be
I see lonely hearts and fallen leaves
Where did those hearts go
Do they find their match
Or do they drift away
It's time to bring them back
They wanna be loved, wanna be loved
Come on it's simple enough
They wanna be loved
They wanna be loved, wanna be loved
A little kiss and a hug
They wanna be loved
Now everybody knows it don't always last
But if I can't have it for long then I want it fast
Better love for now then for never at all
So baby if you down, then gimee a call
I wanna be loved, wanna be loved
Come on it's simple enough
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved, wanna be loved
A little kiss and a hug
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved, wanna be loved
Come on it's simple enough
I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved, wanna be loved
A little kiss and a hug
I wanna be loved
Don't you wanna be loved
Sing for love
Don't you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, wanna be loved
Come on it's simple enough
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved, wanna be loved
A little kiss and a hug
You wanna be loved
