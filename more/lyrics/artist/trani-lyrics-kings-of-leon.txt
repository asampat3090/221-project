Dirty belly of a secret town
Cheap trick hookers that are hanging out at the bar in the Greyhound station
And the bare-chested boys are going down on every thing that the momma believes
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine, help you feel not so strange
Said old Pa, "She don't get off, unless somebody standing near her."
"And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line, cause all tied to the chair."
I said, "Lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound, like a tranny on a ten."
All the bubbas got their heads in a nod,
They don't know what they love or deserve to get
Chances are they tab their worm in a slab,
Doesn't even know which fish that he like to bite tonight, ah tonight, tonight, tonight
Ah maybe tonight
Said old Pa, "She don't get off, unless somebody standing near her."
"And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line, hands all tied to the chair."
I said, "Lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound, like a tranny on a ten."
Comes home on call, isn't that peace,
Fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth
He's spitting out his teeth
I said, Lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound, like a tranny on a ten
