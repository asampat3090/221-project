I like to think that i'm a pretty good kisser
I like to think I maybe broke a few hearts
But since I met you I'm a victim of disaster
I like to think I got it down to an art
So here's where the problem starts
You're shitting on my heart
Oh I can't take it again and again and again
All I wanted from you
Was a night maybe two
You beat me at my own game
No, it's not okay
I'm the one that's missing out
All I needed to do
Was get just a taste of you
And now I'm sick all in my head
You poisened me instead
Trust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down
I like to wake and go to bed around whenever
I like to maybe come and go when I choose
But now I'm waiting for a text, call, whatever
What's gotten into me, besides you (Oops!)
You're like a rush, you're like a drug, it's just the sight of you
I like to think that I could kick you but it's what you do
When you wink at me
What's the lord think of me
For being so fucking weak, I find it hard for me to breathe
So here's where my story ends
I got to make amends
I let me down
Again and again and again and again
All I wanted from you
Was a night maybe two
You beat me at my own game
No, it's not okay
I'm the one that's missing out
All I needed to do
Was get just a taste of you
And now I'm sick all in my head
You poisened me instead
Trust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down
Here's what we have to do
Stay together, keep it true
Can't be strong too late for cool
I won't live without you
(You are not rid of me!)
All I wanted from you
Was a night maybe two
You beat me at my own game
No, it's not okay
I'm the one that's missing out
All I needed to do
Was get just a taste of you
And now I'm sick all in my head
You poisened me instead
Trust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down
