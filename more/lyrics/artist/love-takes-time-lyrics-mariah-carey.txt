Oh, oh
I had, I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone
Love takes time to heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete, yeah
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain?
Tears are falling down endlessly, oh
Love takes time to heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care, oh
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do inside, oh
Love takes time to heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone, oh
