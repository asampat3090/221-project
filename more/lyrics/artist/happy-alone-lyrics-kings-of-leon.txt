rock
On our way, so it seems, blooming flowers waltz before me
Rollin' numbers, passing time, got to get outside the city,
In the morning all will see, just how crazy young love can be
On our own away again, don't get down my darlin'
I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter
Three o'clock and the moaning, they all cry to me,
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels, and your cherry red lipstick,
Look out your window I'm on your street
Miles away, so unclear, almost lost it in Montana
Lets pull over, have us a choke
I love to watch you when your dancin'
I wonder if they ever dream, they would get just what we gave them
All wrapped up in nineteen, chasin' stars that are fallin'
Chorus
When that train heads home,
They're gonna be so gone gone, you ain't never gonna see me
I'm a gone gone, you ain't nothin to me
When they shine them streets, they're gonna find our song
Chorus x2
I'm on your street , they all cry to me
