You know I hate sleepin alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby that was a long time ago
Im not feelin it, Im not feelin it
On top of you not callin me back
You see I bet you think its all on track
And you actin like its all a dat
Im not feelin it, Im not feelin it
Lets go, lets go little Kitty Kat
I think its time to go, lets go little Kitty Kat
He dont want no mo, lets go little Kitty Kat
Quite frankly, no mo gettin' it, Im not feelin' it
Its like we at two places but different paces
We in trouble but you wont meet me at the bridge
It hurts and feels discernin
Did you forget where joy lives?
What about my body, body?
You dont want my body, body
Actin like Im not nobody
You gon make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere Ill be naughty
You know I hate sleepin alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby that was a long time ago
Im not feelin it, Im not feelin it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see I bet you think its all on track
And you actin like its all a dat
Im not feelin it, Im not feelin it
Lets go, lets go little Kitty Kat
I think it's time to go, lets go little Kitty Kat
He dont want no mo, lets go little Kitty Kat
Quite frankly no mo gettin' it, Im not feelin' it
(Let me show you how to get there)
Take a left to compassion, lights will be flashin'
Keep straight and youll see the sign right there
Affection, youre in the wrong direction
If I get caught see it just seems that you dont care
What about my body, body?
You dont want my body, body
Actin' like Im not nobody
You gon make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere Ill be naughty
You know I hate sleepin' alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby that was a long time ago
Im not feelin it, Im not feelin it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see I bet you think its all on track
And you actin like its all a dat
Im not feelin it, Im not feelin it
Lets go, lets go little Kitty Kat
I think its time to go, lets go little Kitty Kat
He dont want no mo, lets go little Kitty Kat
Quite frankly no mo gettin' it, Im not feelin' it
Im takin' back the things I got from you, you
And that includes my sweet little nooky too, too
Lets go, lets go little Kitty Kat
He dont want you anymore, no
Lets go, lets go little Kitty Kat
He dont want you anymore, no
Got diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my records
Since 16 I was comin' down ridin Lexus
How you gon neglect this? You is just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you aint gots to lie Craig
What about my body, body?
You dont want my body, body
Im in the house all alone
You rather go and party?
What about my body, body?
You dont want my body, body
Actin' like Im nobody
You gon make me call somebody
Lets go, lets go little Kitty Kat
I think its time to go, let's Go little Kitty Kat
He aint want no mo, lets go little Kitty Kat
No mo' gettin it Im not feelin it
