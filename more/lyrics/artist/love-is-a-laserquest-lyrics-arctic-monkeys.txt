Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or, darling, have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make believe
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or has somebody's good night kisses got that covered
Well, I'm not being honest
I'll pretend that you were just some lover
Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute it gets easier to pretend
That you were just some lover
When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about something
Well, I've found a better method of pretending
You were just some lover
Well, I've found a better method of pretending
You were just some lover
