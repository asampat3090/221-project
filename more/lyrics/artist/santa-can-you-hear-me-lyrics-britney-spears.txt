Ooh yeah
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me ?
I sign my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I send it off and just said this
I know exactly what I want this year
Santa, can you hear me ?
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me someone to hold
Maybe, Maybe
Be all my own in a big red bow
Santa, can you hear me ?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is here
He's all I want just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa that's my only wish this year.
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep.
Will I be wrong for taking a peek ?
Cause that I heard that you're coming to town.
Santa, can you hear me ?
I really that hope you're on your way,
with Something special for me in your sleigh.
Ooh please make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me ?
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me someone to hold
Maybe, Maybe
we'll be all alone under the mistle toe
Santa, can you hear me ?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is here
He's all I want just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa that's my only wish this year
I hope my letter reaches you in time
woooo yeah
Bring me a love that I can call all mine
Cause I have been so good this year
Can't be alone under the mistle toe
he's all i want in a big red bow
Santa, can you hear me ?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is here
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Ooh Santa
Can you hear me ?
ooh santa
Well he's all I want just for me
underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here..
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Santa, that's my only wish this year
that's a great song we should sing it every year !!!
