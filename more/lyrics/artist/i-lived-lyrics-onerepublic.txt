Hope when you take that jump,
You don't feel the fall.
Hope when the water rises,
You built a wall.
Hope when the crowd screams out
It's screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs
You choose to stay
Hope that you fall in love
And it hurts so bad
The only way you can know
Is give it all you have
And I hope that you don't suffer
But take the pain
Hope when the moment comes, you'll say
I..... I did it all
I..... I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah, worth every broken bone
I swear I lived
Hope that you spend your days
But they all add up
And when that sun goes down
Hope you raise your cup
Oh, oh
I wish that I could witness
All your joy
And all your pain
But until my moment comes
I'll say
I....I did it all
I....I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah worth every broken bone
I swear I lived
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh (x4)
Worth every broken bone
I swear I lived
Worth every broken bone
I swear I
I....I did it all
I....I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah worth every broken bone
I swear I lived
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh (x2)
I swear I lived
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh (x2)
