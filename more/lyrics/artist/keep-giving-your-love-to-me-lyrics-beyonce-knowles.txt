Hey yo, B
This a good look right here, yeah
Bad Boy, baby, uh
Hey yo, B
I've been wanting to explain to you what it is that you do to me
Got me open, I am so in love with loving you
Touching places, no one else has ever made me feel incredible
When you touch me, I feel sexy, no one else like you
Got me going off all the love you give me
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands belong over there
Please don't say you're gonna stop loving me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, the way you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
I lose all control when you are here and baby, it amazes me
How could someone be so sexy and love like you do
Oh baby, do you understand the power that you posses over me
Can't accept this feeling and I don't think I want to
Got me going off all the love you give me
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands belong over there
Please don't say you're gonna stop loving me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, the way you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
It's crazy how much I'm in love with you
It's all 'cause you love me the way you do
Don't want no other love but you
'Cause no one else has ever made me feel this good
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
