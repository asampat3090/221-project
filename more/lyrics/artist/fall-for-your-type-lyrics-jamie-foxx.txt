Can I, can I save you from you?
'Cause you notice something missing
And that champagne you've been sipping
I suppose to make you different all the time
Is starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, girl
'Cause with all the recognition
It gets hard for you to listen to the things
That I'm gonna say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun, girl
We'll be fine
Tryin' to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type
For your type
(I just can't explain this shit at all)
Fall for your type
(I just can't explain this shit at all)
Fall for your type
(I believe in people like you)
So who am I to judge you on the past, girl?
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late, I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me
Hearts won't break and end up like before
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type
For your type
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing, you just drunk, you just saying shit
And oh, you dance? Dance like how? Like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait, no, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah, I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
'Cause, man, it's been a while, and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes and I'm just trying to correct it and I fall
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type
For your type
(I just can't explain this shit at all)
Fall for your type
(I just can't explain this shit at all)
Fall for your type
(I believe in people like you)
