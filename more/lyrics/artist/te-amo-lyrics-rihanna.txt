"Te amo, te amo," she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra, she takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over
Then she said "te amo"
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried "te amo"
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go
My soul is awry, without asking why
I said, "te amo, wish somebody'd tell me what she said"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over
Then she said "te amo"
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried "te amo"
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go
My soul is awry, without asking why
I said, "te amo, wish somebody'd tell me what she said"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Listen we can dance, but you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night, I'm movin' to the light because I understand
That we all need love and I'm not afraid
I feel the love, but I don't feel that way
Then she said "te amo"
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried "te amo"
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go
My soul is awry, without asking why
I said, "te amo, wish somebody'd tell me what she said"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
I love you
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you?
