Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, 'cause she be that lady, hey!
I feel you creeping up , I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down
Konvicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardobe intact now
I feel it, don and crack now
Ooh I see it, don't let back now
I'ma call her then I put the mack down
Money? No problem, pocket full of that now
I feel you creeping up, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a lil drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon
You can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, and shes like, "You're..."
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place"
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing
Akon!
I feel you creeping up, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
Eminem's rollin', D an' em rollin'
Boo and ol' Marvelous an' them rollin'
Women just holdin'big booty rollin'
Soon I be all in 'em an' throwin D
Hittin' no less than three
Block wheel style, like whee
Girl I can tell you want me 'cause lately
I feel you creeping up, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
