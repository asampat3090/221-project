I've been fragile for a long time
A big, old hole inside my heart
And I was searching through the valley
Stumbled on love, in the dark
Was afraid to try but afraid to never know
What it feels like to be loved
Had a hill to climb but the places we could go
Oh, I gotta know
So if we ever fell in love
Would the wind know? Would the pain go? Oh
So if we ever fell in love
Oh, oh, oh
I was empty, it was all gone
The birds would sing but made no sound
Till I met you, found I was all wrong
You picked me up right off the ground
Was afraid to try and afraid I'd fall again
Crashing down from the sky, you know
Had a hill to climb but with you I my heart will mend
That's the one thing we all wanna know
So if we ever fell in love
Would the wind blow? Would the pain go? Oh
So if we ever fell in love
Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna know, know, I just wanna know
Tell me, tell me so, baby, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, know, I just wanna know
Tell me, tell me so, baby, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, know, I just wanna know
Tell me, tell me so, baby, I just wanna know
So if we ever fell in love
Would the wind know? Would the pain go? Oh
So if we ever fell in love
Oh, oh, oh
So if we ever fell in love
Oh, I wanna know what it feels like to be loved
