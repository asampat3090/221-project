I keep my hopes and dreams inside of you amongst the other things my mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering,
Never been known by my government name, my foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain,
So as you sit before me with a folder holding my story, you're my savior with nothing on me but power and glory,
And surely you'll never ignore cos when the the court came the court date was made to disappear for me,
You think you understand me but never what I went through but you were never meant to I won't hold it against you,
I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot with the cigarette burns etched in my forearms,
Forget me not never let me stop you'll just sit and watch it's your job to be patient so you'll let me off,
So come with me take a walk on the wild side, see life in a day through a child's eyes,
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me,
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away, away,
Okay sessions over time to get back to the classroom I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard to,
You told me I should try my best but guess what I still find this trigonometry a head fuck,
Constantly told I won't pass my GCSE's,
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese,
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it,
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em,
Lately classmates think I'm crazy turn up daily resembling bill bailey,
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it without new clothes or shower it hard to do,
So after school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes but they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home,
So come with me take a walk on the wild side see life in a day through a child's eyes,
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me,
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away, away.
