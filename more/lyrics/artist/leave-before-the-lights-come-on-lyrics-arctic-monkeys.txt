Well, this is a good idea
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
Well, my friend fancies you
Oh, what a way to begin it all
You said they're always exciting words to hear
They woke up together
Not quite realizing how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning
And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And oh, there's nothing left to guess now
They left before the lights came on
Because they didn't want to ruin
What it was that was brewing
Before they absolutely had to
And how can you wake up
With someone you don't love?
And not feel slightly phased by it
Oh, he had a struggle
They woke up together
Not quite realizing how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning
And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And oh, there's nothing left to guess now
Quick, let's leave
Before the lights come on
'Cos then you don't have to see
'Cos then you don't have to see what you've done
Quick, let's leave
Before the lights come on
'Cos then you don't have to see
'Cos then you don't have to see what you've done
I'll woke you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll woke you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll woke you up, what time's the bus come?
