I believe if I knew where I was going I'd lose my way
I believe that the words that he told you are not your grave
I know that we are not the weight of all our memories
I believe in the things that I am afraid to say
Hold on
Hold on
I believe in the lost possibilities you can't see
And I believe that the darkness
Reminds us where light can be
I know that your heart is still beating beating darling
I believe that you fell so you would land next to me
Hold on
Hold on
'Cause I have been where you are before
And I have felt the pain of losing who you are
And I have died so many times
But I am still alive
I believe that tomorrow is stronger than yesterday
And I believe that your head is the only thing in your way
I wish that you could see your scars turn into beauty
I believe that today its okay to be not okay
Hold on
Hold on
'Cause I have been where you are before
And I have felt the pain of losing who you are
And I have died so many times
But I am still alive
