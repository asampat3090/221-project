If we take this bird in, with its broken leg,
We could nurse it, she said,
Come inside for a little lie down with me,
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder,
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh.
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,
Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird.
My little bird.
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew,
We can lay down, so I'm next to you,
Come inside for a little home made tea,
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me,
And if I wake up, you see its late love, get back to sleep,
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now,
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me.
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,
Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird.
My little bird,
My little bird,
My little bird.
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love,
You make me scream, and then I made you cry,
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die.
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,
Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird.
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoaa,
My little bird,
My little bird,
You're my little bird...
