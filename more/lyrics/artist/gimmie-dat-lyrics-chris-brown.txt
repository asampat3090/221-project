Chris Brown is in the building
The young boy just turned 16
And I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk
That sassy tempo with that walk
May be the reason that all these teenies may never see me
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac,
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you
What ya body got a young boy ready to do
If you take a chance to let me put them things on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's in school
I'm a hustla, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes in the coupe
With you on the phone screaming my name
(Chris!)
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme
