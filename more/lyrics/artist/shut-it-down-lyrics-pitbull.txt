Mr. 305, I want everybody
To get down 'cause we about to shut down
Oh, can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly
Oh, can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky
Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down
Now watch me, now watch me
Now watch me shut this thang down
Sube, sube, hasta la nube
Pa'lante delante
No mires pa'tras
I hit the jackpot
Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-ching
Real chicos do real things
On the road to the riches, get diamond rings
Moved up from the streets
Graduated hustla
On his way to an entrepreneur
Undefeated, done shooter
Now baby, save me
From the game before it plays me
My life's a movie
Call me Martin Scorsese
I can care less if you love me or hate me
Life's a bitch, now fuck, you pay me
Sube, sube, hasta la nube
Pa'lante delante
No mires pa'tras
Oh, can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly
Oh, can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky
Lose my money, honey
Now pay me what you own me
Mom is a hurricane
You should see the way she blow me
I don't make it rain
I speak that global warming
This ain't no biggy, ready to that
Number 5, there is no warning
Now baby, save me
From the game before it plays me
My life's a movie
Call me Martin Scorsese
I can care less if you love me or hate me
Life's a bitch, now fuck, you pay me
Sube, sube, hasta la nube
Pa'lante delante
No mires pa'tras
Oh, can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky
Oh, can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly
Oh, can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky
Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down
Now watch me, now watch me
Now watch me shut this thang down
It's my life, I'ma do what I do
And if you don't like it, it's cool, fuck you
