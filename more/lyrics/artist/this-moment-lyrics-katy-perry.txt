Can you tell me, who called the race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
I say one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can't push rewind
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put our love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
Do you ever think that, we're just chasing our tails?
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize
But you know who I, who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put our love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front of you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
A future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby don't blink and miss
This moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put our love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
