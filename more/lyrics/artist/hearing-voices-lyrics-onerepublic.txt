Start, I'm might start with this
Just a single thought followed by words
I hope I don't miss, miss anything
Write you a letter but it's better that you hear me
I suppose, I could sing
Write a song to share the meaning
Of the love for you I'm feeling
People saying what they will, I don't care
I'm hearing voices all around
I'm hearing voices calling out
What would they say?
What would it change?
I'm hearing voices all around
I'm hearing voices making sounds
What would they take?
What would they say to me if only I was listening?
Catch my 22, I'd gladly give it to somebody
Because I only wanna be with you
I lost and used your love
I start to drown and you go and pull me up
Don't you listen to what they say?
I'm hearing voices all around
I'm hearing voices calling out
What would they say?
What would it change?
I'm hearing voices all around
I'm hearing voices making sounds
What would they take?
What would they say if I was listening?
Come here, there's something I should tell you
Darling, don't fear 'cause I am going, going away
Voices all around
I'm hearing voices
What will they say?
What will they say?
I'm hearing voices
Voices all
Voices all around
I'm hearing voices all around
