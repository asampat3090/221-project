Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
Where did you read my story?
Pulled from the papers, desperate and hardened
Seeking a momentary fix
All I wanted to say, all I wanted to do
Has fallen apart now
All I wanted to feel, I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy I fear
Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
And I see you, whoa
And I feel you, whoa
Fortress of daylight, caught me on standby
Waiting to catch the quickest plane
Fly me to nowhere, it's better than somewhere
Thats where Ive been and nothings changed
All I wanted to say, all I wanted to do
Has fallen apart now
All I wanted to feel
I wanted to love, it's all my fault now
A tragedy for sure
Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
And I see you, whoa
And I feel you, whoa
I'm so lost in you
A tragedy it seemed to be, but what now?
What now?
A tragedy it seemed to be, but what now?
Angel of mercy, how did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, how did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
And I see you, whoa
And I feel you, whoa
I feel you, whoa
I feel you, whoa
