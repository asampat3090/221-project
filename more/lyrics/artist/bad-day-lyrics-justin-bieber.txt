No I didn't think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl) And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, baby yea
And that moment was so hard for me to breathe
'Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life is so unpredictable, yeah
Never thought a love like yours could leave me all alone (oh no)
Didn't waste any time
Like you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
'Cause I was out of line (oh, yeah)
But I didn't think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, girl
It was a bad day (hey, yeah, yeah)
I know I was wrong
But you could have said "goodbye" baby
It was a bad day
Now I'm like, "wow"
It was a bad day
It was a bad day
It was a bad day
