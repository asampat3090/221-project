pop
Usher, Usher, Usher
(Yeah man)
So we back in the club with the bodies rockin' from side to side
Thank God the week is done, I feel like a zombie gone back to life
Hands up, yeah suddenly we all got our hands up, no control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
Keep downing drinks like there's no tomorrow
There's just right now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherfucker down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Hands up, when the music drops, we both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
Usher, don't lie
Hear no evil, or speak no evil, or see no evil
Get it, baby, hope you catch it like T.O., that's how we roll
My life is a movie, and you just Tivo
Honey got me swishin' like a dreadlock
She don't wrestle, but I got her in a headlock
Yabba dabba doo, make her bed rock
Mami on fire, pss, red hot
Bada bing, bada boom
Mr. Worldwide as I step in the room
I'm a hustler, baby, but that you knew
And tonight it's just me and you
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love, fallin' in love
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gon' get you right
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
