rock
I'm sippin' coffee at a quarter to two
I wake and I'm dialin' and my mind's runnin' to you
No wonder I'm a one woman man
She keeps my heart in a jar on the nightstand
I should tell her that she couldn't be more
Opposite than a foot in the door
There's no one else I would rather go out with
That's hell when I see them standin' there
Me and my mouth, we don't mean to be rushin'
We talk about thee freely 'cos we crushin'
I wanna shake both sides of the butt, yeah
Theoretically yes, ain't we lucky
And when the coyotes, they sing in the park
It's when the city lights start fallin' for the sea
While them roads are windin' down
And the flying men'll hit the ground
Every motion is close to the touch
And the coyotes sing when they call on your lovin'
Hello, we're comin' back for more
You know why we're comin' for you
You know we should be, we should be together
'Cause once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow
And not today or tomorrow, oh no
You better lock your doors
You know why, 'cause we want you
'Cause we like you a lot
I wish the world was a lot like you
I wish the world would know me through
Another opportunity to approach you
Another telepathic rendezvous
I wish you well with your weapon of jargon
You got a double sided lexicon
I gotta try to keep your attention
Gotta write usin' less emoticons
I gotta figure out the snooze alarm
I wanna lay in your place till dark
I wanna play in the park, come on
Now let me see your other upper echelon
And when the coyotes escape to New York
Then the city life has crumbled to the sea
And the girls, all fall to the lost and found
The flying men'll hit the ground
Every motion is closer to touching the coyotes sing
When they taste on your lovin'
I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your lovin'
We're comin' back for more
You know why we're comin' for you
You know we should be, we should be together
Because once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow, not today or tomorrow, oh no
Because once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow
We're comin' back for more
You know why we're comin' for you
You know we should be, we should be together
'Cause once we rock, we won't wanna stop
Not today or tomorrow
