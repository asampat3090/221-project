I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you'd say
We could've made everything okay
But we just threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Super natural love conquers all
Remember we used to touch the sky
And lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift but we let it drift in a storm
Every night I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry
Limitless omnipresent, kind of love couldn't have guessed
It would just stop and disappear in the whirlwind
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling
But won't let go, waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow
I know I can stand, just pull me back up
But there ain't no hurricane, it's just us
I'm willing to live and die for our love
Baby, we can get back that shine
'Cause lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, but we let it drift in a storm
Every night I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose
We gotta ride it through, I'm reaching for you
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose
We gotta ride it through, I'm reaching for you
Lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it slip in a storm
Every night I feel the angels cry, the angels cry
Oh baby, don't let the angels cry
