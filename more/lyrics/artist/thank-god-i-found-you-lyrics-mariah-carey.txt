I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I've finally found a man that's true
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heart it would not subside
I felt like dying until you saved my life
Thank God I found you, I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight, completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude 'cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you
I would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
Because without you beside me I can't survive
I don't wanna try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be all right 'cause I need you in my life
Thank God I found you
(I'm begging you)
I was lost without you
(So lost without you)
My every wish and every dream
(Every dream, every dream)
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
(Brought the sunlight)
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude 'cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you
See I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back, I guess it shows that we were destined to shine
After the rain to appreciate, the gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again to be able to feel this way
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
(Lost without you, baby)
My every wish and every dream somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
(Whole life)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude, sweet baby, I'm so thankful I found you
Thank God I found you, I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude, my baby, I'm so thankful I found you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude, my baby, I'm so thankful I found you
