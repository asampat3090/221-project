Give me all, give me all, give me all attention baby
I got to tell you a little something about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(fine, so fine)
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine(mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
oh oooooh
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true
Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(fine, so fine)
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine(mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you

You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are
You are my treasure, you are my treasure

Treasure, that is what you are

I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
