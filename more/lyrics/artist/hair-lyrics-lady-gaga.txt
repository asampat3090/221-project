Whenever I'm dressed cool my parents put up a fight
And if I'm hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
And in the morning I'm short of my identity
I scream, "Mom and dad, why can't I be who I wanna be, to be?"
I just wanna be myself and I want you to love
Me for who I am
I just wanna be myself and I want you to know
I am my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
Free as my hai-ai-air
Hai-ai-air, hair
Free as my hai-ai-air
Hai-ai-air, hai-ai-air
Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
I've got my bangs to hide but I don't stand a chance, a chance
I just wanna be myself and I want you to love
Me for who I am
I just wanna be myself and I want you to know
I am my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
Free as my hai-ai-air
Hai-ai-air, hair
Free as my hai-ai-air
Hai-ai-air, hai-ai-airr
I just want to be free, I just want to be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't want to change and I don't want to be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my hair, it's all the glory that I bear
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair, I am my hair
It's all the glory that I bear
I'm my hair, I am my hair
It's all the glory that I bear
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
It's all the glory that I bear
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
It's all the glory that I bear
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
It's all the glory that I bear
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
Ooh, I'm my hair, I'm my hair
