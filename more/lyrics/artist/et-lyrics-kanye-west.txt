[Kanye West]
I got a dirty mind
I got filthy ways
I'm tryna lay my egg, egg, in your Milky Way
I'm a legend, I'm irreverent
I be reverend
I be so far u-u-u-u-up, we don't give a fuck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They calling me an alien
A big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because your boy Yeezy get ass a lot
[Katy Perry]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil
Could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Diff-erent DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Your so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
[Kanye West]
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they driving spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada spacesuit about the stars
Getting stupid ass straight about the charge
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on ya dick
Tell me what's next, aliens have sex
I'mma disrobe you, than I'mma probe you
See I abducted you, so I tell ya what to do
I tell ya what to do, what to do, what to do
[Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you're, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
