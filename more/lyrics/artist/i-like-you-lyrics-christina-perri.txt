It's like a little piece of heaven
When you stay
You make me feel like it's all
Okay
And now I know that the sun
Will only shine
When the clouds go away
Cause thats how you make me feel
Thats how you make me feel today
And you're like a little piece of candy
On my tongue
You're so much
Fun
And i flip like a butterfly
With one look in your eyes
Thats how you make me feel
Thats how you make me feel tonight
And I think I like you
And I think you like me too
Lets keep dreaming and wishing
This way
Growups don't take enough time
To play
Love, and so, it matters at the end of the day
That's how you make me feel
Thank you for making me feel this way
And I think I like you
And I think you like me too
