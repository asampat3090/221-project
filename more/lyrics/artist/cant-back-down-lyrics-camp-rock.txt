We can't back down
Not right now
We can't back down
Not right now
We can't back down
We can't back down
Don't close your eyes
We're all in this together
Wherever we draw the line
We're not gonna straddle across it
Or lose it
We can't back down
There's too much at stake
This is serious
We've been called out
(We've been called out)
Do you hear your name?
(Yeah)
I'm not confused
Let's win this thing
(Let's do it)
We can't back down
There's too much at stake
Don't walk away
Don't walk away, yeah
Don't get me wrong
I don't like confrontation
I'd rather we all just get along
Music should be undivided, united
We can't back down
There's too much at stake
This is serious
Don't walk away
We can't pretend it's not happening
In our own backyard
Our own home plate
(No way)
We've been called out
(We've been called out)
Do you hear your name?
(Yeah)
I'm not confused
Let's win this thing
(Let's do it)
We can't back down
There's too much at stake
Don't walk away
Don't walk away, yeah
We got a situation that we can't ignore
'Cause ignorance is not bliss
We don't have to take this, no
With every big decision
Comes an equally important share of the risk
We gotta take this
We can't back down
There's too much at stake
This is serious
Don't walk away
We can't pretend it's not happening
In our own backyard
Our own home plate
We've been called out!
Do you hear your name?
I'm not confused
Let's win this thing
We can't back down
There's too much at stake
Don't walk away
Don't walk away, yeah
We can't back down
We can't back down
Not right now
