[Sean Kingston:]
Eenie meenie miney mo
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla' (if, if, if she holla) let her go
Shes indecisive
She can't decide
She keeps on lookin'
From left to right
Girl, c'mon get closer
Look in my eyes
Searchin' is so wrong
I'm Mr. Right
You seem like the type
To love em' and leave em'
And disappear right after the song.
So give me the night
To show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone
You can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time
I'm not tryin' to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
Cause shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
[Justin Bieber:]
Let me show you what your missin'
Paradise
With me you're winning girl
You don't have to roll the dice
Tell me what you're really here for
Them other guys?
I can see right through ya'
You seem like the type
To love em' and leave em'
And disappear right after the song.
So give me the night
To show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone
Can't make up your mind
Please don't waste my time
Not tryin' to rewind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
Cause shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
[Sean Kingston:]
Eenie meenie miney moe
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla' (if, if, if she holla) let her go
Eenie meenie miney moe
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla' x2
let her go
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Can't make up your mind
Please don't waste my time
Not tryin' to rewind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
x2
