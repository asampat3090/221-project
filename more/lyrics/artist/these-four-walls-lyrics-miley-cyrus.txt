These four walls, they whisper to me
They know a secret, I knew they would not keep
Didn't take long for the room to fill with dust
And these four walls came down around us
It must have been something, send me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
It's hard now to let you be
I won't make excuses, I may not keep
Didn't take long for me to lose the trust
'Cause these four walls were not strong enough, oh
It must have been something, send me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
Yeah, it's difficult watching us fade
Knowing it's all my fault, my mistake
Yeah, it's difficult letting you down
Knowing it's all my fault, you're not around
It must have been something, send me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again, again
Ooh, these four walls again
