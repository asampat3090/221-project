Paramore
rock
Maybe if my heart stops beating
It won't hurt this much
And never will I have to answer
Again to anyone
Please don't get me wrong
Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't want to be alone
But now I feel like I don't know you
One day you'll get sick of
Saying that everything's alright
And by then I'm sure I'll be pretending
Just like I am tonight
Please don't get me wrong
Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't want to be alone
But now I feel like I don't know you
Let this go, let this go
But I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't want to be alone
But now I feel like I don't know you
I'll never let this go
I can't find the words to tell you
That now I feel like I don't know you
