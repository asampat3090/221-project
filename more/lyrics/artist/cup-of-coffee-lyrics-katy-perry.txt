pop
I take these turns
A bit too fast
Trying to leave you
In my past
The CD skips
Our favorite songs
Our greatest hits
Just don't belong
I really love
To hate this
Love hate
Hate love relationships
Are over-rated
Over my dead body
Is how this will end
He said it's over
And I could go for
Another chance to do
This over again
So this is it?
After all
We've been through
We call it quits
And-a I'm about to
Wash my prints
Oh
The little I had left
He said it's over
And I could really go
For a cup of coffee
And an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it
When you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cover up copy
And an overdose
I pop these pills
Like cracker jacks
And the price
That plays dice
Just watching you react
When your depressed you
Sleep too much
I'm not sure
If I'm waking up
It's over rated
Over my dead body
Is how this will end
You said it'd over
And I could go
For another chance to do
This over again
So this is it?
After all
We've been through
We call it quits
And-a I'm about
To wash my prints
Oh
The little I had left
He said it's over
And I could really go
For a cup of coffee
And an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it
When you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee
And an overdose
He said it's over
And I could really go
For a cup of coffee
And an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it
When you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
I stood in line
Without you
I stood in line
Without you
And I don't tell you
What it is
I thought about you
Well, without you
Is everything I've got
