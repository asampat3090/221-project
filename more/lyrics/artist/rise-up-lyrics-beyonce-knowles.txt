I'm the matriarch of your land
When you need to take my hand
Come into my arms, I'll keep you safe from harm
I'll keep your precious heart
Some people try to drag you down
Take it from me, stand and be proud
You're a warrior
You're my warrior
Be who you are
Be who you are
Know that life holds more than what you see
Rise up little man, rise up little man
Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise
They'll burn you at the stake if you
Don't act like they want you to
But baby be yourself
Do good and help the world
Be who you are
Be who you are
Know that life holds more than what you see
Rise up little man, rise up little man
Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise
Rise up, rise up little man
Don't be scared I'm holding your hand
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get
Rise up, rise up little woman
Don't be afraid to risk it all
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get, I will
Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise
