rock
I hear she's kicking ass across the board
And rock two hundred thousand higher scorer
Just in time to save the world of being taken over
She's a warrior
I couldn't play again because the game
It never end it never even landed on the can
And never let me in to spend my quarter
There's no love for me no more
Say, it isn't so
How she easily come, and she easy go
Please don't tell her
That been meaning to miss her
Because I don't
She was the girl with the broadest shoulders
But she would die before I crawled over them
She is taller than I am
She knew I wouldn't mind the view there
Or the altitude with a mouth full of air
She let me down and doubt came out until
The now became later
Say that it isn't so
How she easily come, how she easy go
Please don't tell her
Because I don't really need to know
That I'm crazy like the rest of us
And I'm crazier when I'm next to her
So why after the all of everything that came and went
I care enough to still be singing of the bitter end and broken eras
I told you I don't but
I am only trying to be the best with my intent to cure
The rest is sure to lay me ease
The plural hurts of the words of reverse psychology
That's easier said, easier than done
Please don't dare tell her what I've become
Please don't mention all the attention I have drawn
Please don't bother 'cause she'll feel guilty when I'm gone
Because I'm crazy like the rest of us
But I'm crazier when I'm next to her
And it's amazing how she's so self-assured
But I know she'd hate me if she knew my words
Do I hurt anymore, do I hurt, well
I don't, I don't, I don't
