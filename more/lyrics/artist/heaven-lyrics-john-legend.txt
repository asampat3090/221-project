Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Last night was the worst night, beginning of the end
Or maybe it began before and here we go again
Things got so dramatic, things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine, I don't understand
There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong, oh, you always seem to blame me
But now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go? Will I ever know? Heaven only knows
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Let's make this night the best night, it's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
Sometimes when we're talking words get drowned on by the sound
So let's get back to touch and we'll get back on solid ground
Let's hold hands like the young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love like way back in the day, love?
We can lose control, baby don't say no, heaven only knows
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Make this night the best night, it's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we could start to dance
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
