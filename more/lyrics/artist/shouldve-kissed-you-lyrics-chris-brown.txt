Why am I mad? I don't get it
It seems like every time you give me signs and I miss it
I did it again, I admit it
I left you standing there and now I regret it
Seems like every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it
And I get all tongue tied, lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel
No, I did not give you my two cents
A million reasons why I should have and it makes no sense
So here I am by myself again
Stopping for green lights and I know
I wanna be more than friends
How come every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it?
And I get all tongue tied, lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it, hey
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel
So I turned the car around and you were right where I left you
And your smile said you were feeling me too
And then the moon shined bright
'Cause when your lips met mine
Yeah, I finally got it right
I'll be leaving with you tonight
And I won't have to say
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you, girl
I should've showed you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel
Girl, I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And this time I won't stop until I have your heart
'Cause what I'm feeling is real
