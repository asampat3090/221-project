One, two, three
Nowhere, yeah we're going nowhere fast
Maybe this time I'll be yours, you'll be mine
C-c-crazy, ah, get your ass in my bed
Baby, you'll be just my summer boyfriend
(Summerboy)
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini tops, coming off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around
I've got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all
Sometimes you might start a fight
But I'm happy pretending we're alright
(Alright)
Sun glasses cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah
While checking out other guys
(Summerboy)
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini tops, coming off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around
I've got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all
Hey, there summerboy
Let's go for a drive
Take me for a ride
Never gonna close our eyes
Hey, there summerboy
I'm a busy girl
Don't got too much time
Hurry up before I change my mind
Hey, there summerboy
I'm taking off my heels
Let's go for run
Have a little summer fun
Have a little summer fun
(Summerboy)
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini tops, coming off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around
You've got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
I've got my summer, summerboy
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around
I've got my summer, summerboy
And we'll still have the summer after all
I've got my, yes, I've got my
I've got my summer, summerboy
