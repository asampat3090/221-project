rock
We all want someone to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But your heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been where we've been
Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers?
Are they there at all, or is it just paranoia?
Everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicidal
Won't crack or compromise
Your do-rights or individes
Will never unhinge us
And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Yeah, long before ya
Just cos we're having a say-so
Not lining up to be playdoh
Oh, in five years time, will it be
"Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?"
'Cause everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicidal
Won't crack or compromise
Your do-rights or individes
Will never unhinge us

(La la la la la, la la)
(La la la la la, la la)
(La la la la la, la la)
All the thoughts that I just said
Will linger round and multiply in their head
Not that bad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed
It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues...
It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash!
It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue
It's not you it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape?
