Pink
pop
I'm lyin' here on the floor where you left me
I think, I took too much
I'm cryin' here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun
I can't stay on your life support, there's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine, 'cuz its makin' me itch
I said, I tried to call the nurse again but she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
You keep makin' me ill
I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills, they were different
Maybe I should get some help
I can't stay on your life support, there's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine, 'cuz its makin' me itch
I said, I tried to call the nurse again but she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
You keep makin' me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
You keep makin' me ill
I can't stay on your life support, there's a shortage in the switch
(Just like a pill)
I can't stay on your morphine, 'cuz its makin' me itch
(Just like a pill)
I said, I tried to call the nurse again but she's being a little bitch
(Just like a pill)
I think I'll get outta here, where I can
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
(Frustrated, frustrated fears)
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
You keep makin' me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
(Frustrated fears)
And I swear you're just like a pill
(Just like a pill)
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
(Makin' me, makin' me ill)
You keep makin' me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
(Oh you keep makin' me ill)
You keep makin' me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
