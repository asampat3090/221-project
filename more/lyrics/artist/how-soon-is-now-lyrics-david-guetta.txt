After tonight, there'll be no coming home soon
No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume
No more dancing feet to the beats that go boom
While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room
Tonight there'll be no pouring rain
No eyes wide shut to your never ending game
Tonight there'll be no me and you
No distant memories past for me to hold on to
See everybody's working to hold on to what they know
So I guess I kept believing my tonight will never go
Some spend a lifetime searching trying to figure out
Where hell stops and heaven begins
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now?
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now?
After tonight there'll be no coming home soon
No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume
No more dancing feet to the beats that go boom
While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room
Tonight there'll be no pouring rain
No eyes wide shut to your never ending game
After tonight there'll be no me and you
No distant memories past for me to hold on to
See everybody's working to hold on to what they know
So I guess I kept believing my tonight will never go
Some spend a lifetime searching trying to figure out
Where hell stops and heaven begins
How soon is now? How soon is now?
How soon is now? How soon is now?
