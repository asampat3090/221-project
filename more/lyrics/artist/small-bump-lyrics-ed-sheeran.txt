[Verse 1]
You were just a Small Bump unborn, in Four months you're brought to life,
You might be left with my hair, but you'll have your Mother's eyes,
I'll hold your body in my hands be as gentle as I can, but for now you're scan of my unmade plans,
Small bump four months you are brought to life
[Pre-chorus]
And I'll whisper quietly, I'll give you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you
[Chorus]
You are my one, and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
You are my one, and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
And you'll be alright.
[Verse 2]
You're just a small bump I know, you'll grow into your skin.
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin.
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice.
And eyelids closed till soon opened wide a small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes.
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll hold you tightly, and tell you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you
[Chorus]
You are my one, and only.
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
You are my one, and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
And you'll be alright.
[Bridge]
And you can lie with me, with your tiny feet when your half asleep, I'll leave you be.
Right in front of me for a couple weeks.
So I can keep you safe.
[Chorus]
'Cause you are my one, and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
You are my one, and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
And you'll be alright.
[Outro]
'Cause you were just a small bump unborn, for four months then torn from life.
'Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why.
