Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it under cover
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Try to stop my hands from shakin'
Somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we've been all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'
As you leave me please would you close the door
And don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Yeah
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Lose your love
Lose your love
Lose your love
Lose your love
(Lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(Lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(Lose your love)
(Lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(Lose your love)
(Lose your love)
Tonight
