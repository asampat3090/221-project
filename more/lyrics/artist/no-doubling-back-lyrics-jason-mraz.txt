rock
I would like to hold your hand
As we shifted through this twisted abandon
I would like to think
That you'd know your way
We have dodged the ropes of rain
Where the cats and the dogs where they love to play on
A handsome fella with umbrella
Who once saved you your day
And I will ask you to open my door from the side
From the inside after you drive
Because I wanna stay awake for a little bit longer
That's why
Warm the engine compartment up
While I stand here and think it up
But it's a little too early to bury the worries
Still this wish is my command
And aha ha, well I wonder, wonder which one of us
Is gonna state the obvious
And aha ha, well I wonder if you already know
That I gotta let you go
I know this ain't the way I planned it
I guess I ain't the great romantic
And I'm not doublin' back now
No doublin' back, doublin' back now
Well, before I catch you complainin'
That it hardly rains at all
Let me stop to lock my top
For fear of it fallin' harder
[Incomprehensible] eyes [Incomprehensible] easily
Arms are scars of where
The war was waged on
Words that we heard as a joke
How did it drown our love? Oh love
When it rains, it's sure to pour
But when I look in your eyes
I fear I won't see surprise
That I'm not doublin' back
And aha ha, well, I wonder, wonder which one of us
Is gonna state the obvious
And aha ha, well, I wonder if you already know
That I gotta let you go
I know this ain't the way I planned it
I guess I ain't the great romantic
And I'm not doublin' back now
No doublin' back, doublin' back now
Here it comes
The drop of rain if hit my tongue
And I swear I love you all
[Incomprehensible]
You see there ain't no way, no way I planned it
I guess I ain't the great romantic
And I'm not doublin' back now
No doublin' back, doublin' back now
No turnin' around
No doublin' back, doublin' back now
No doublin' back, doublin' back now
