Maybe, it's me, maybe I bore you
No no, it's my fault 'coz I can't afford you
Maybe baby, Puffy, Jay Z
Would all be better for you 'coz all I could do is love you
Baby, when I used to love U
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Do anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of livin' this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realized that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
La la la la
Yeah
Ala la la
Yeah, yeah
Maybe, I should rob somebody
So we could live like Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault, my bad, my loss
But you are above cost, all I could do was love you
Baby, when I used to love U
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Do anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of livin' this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realized that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
La la la la
Yeah
Ala la la
Yeah, yeah
Do you remember when I used to love U?
Baby, no not any more, I don't love you
Ooh, I used to love you
And you're gonna miss me now
Baby, when I used to love U
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
And I'm not gonna play the fool
No, I can't live this life and I can't justify
And I can't make up my life
'Coz I don't love you
Not like I used to do
La la la la
Not like I used to
Ala la la
Not like I used to
Oh, I used to love U
Oh, but I don't love you
Oh, I used to love U
Oh, but I don't love you
Oh, I used to love U
Oh, but I don't love you
Oh, but I don't love you
I bet you miss me now
Oh, but I don't love you
