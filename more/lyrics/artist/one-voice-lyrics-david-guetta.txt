electronic
One light for direction
Through the valley of night
One chance to be heard
And it's well worth the fight
Uh you better keep your body moving
Don't wait for a feeling
To finally grow
Into an answer you've been hearing
Because you already know
But they can't take it away, they can't take it away
But they can't take it away, they can't take it away
Come on with me
One voice and it's got to be you
We can only get one heart
And it's got to be through
So if your love is breakthrough, turns voice
You cannot live without a voice
You cannot live without a voice
