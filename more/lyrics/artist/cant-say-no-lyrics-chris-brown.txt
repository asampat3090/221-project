I can't tell you no
Cause you're irresistible (No)
My heart, my mind
Is spinning at the same time
The thought of you is why
Cause without you girl the sun don't shine
The places we go is straight out of a fairy tale
We're in love all over again
So I can never say
No
Cause you changed my life
I'll never walk away
Cause day by day
Your love (your love)
Your touch (touch)
I'm staying
Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I could never say
No, no, no, no, no
I could never say
No, no, no, no, no
I could never say
No, no, no, no, no
I could never say
No, no
You put a spell on me
Girl without you it's hard to breathe
It's like you are my air
Made a man out of me
Cause your love it sets me free
And when I need you you're there
The places we go are straight out of a fairy tale
Baby
We're in love all over again
I can never say no
Cause you changed my life
I'll never walk away
Cause day by day
Your love (your love)
Your touch (touch)
I'm staying
Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I could never say
No, no, no, no, no
I could never say
No, no, no, no, no
I could never say
No, no, no, no, no
I could never say
No, no
All my ladies right now
I just wanna' see you smile
Let it shine bright now
If you love me baby scream it out
Say
Ohhh, ohh Ohhhhh Ohhhh
I can never say
I can never say no
Cause you changed my life
I'll never walk away
Cause day by day
Your love (your love)
Your touch (touch)
I'm staying
Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I can't tell you no
(I'm in love girl)
I can't tell you no
(when it's raining or it's pouring outside - Ima' have you by my side)
I can't tell you no
(In love forever - always be together)
I can't tell you no
(Make it last forever - Make it last forever)
