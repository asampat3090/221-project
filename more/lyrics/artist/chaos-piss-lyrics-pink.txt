Pink
pop
I thought that you were driving, but you've given me the wheel
There's rain clouds out there, that you don't wanna feel
Your anger's like a razor blade, it's just too bloody real
I thought that you would be here, no I just don't get it
Hey I also feel things more than I should
I don't relax very often, as often as I could
I worry how the whole thing looks, it doesn't look good
But I thought that you would be here, no I just don't get it
And being clear gets too much for me, just like it does for you
Even though I want to, I want to, I don't
I don't feel like calming down, no I don't
I don't feel like hiding out, so I won't
I can't turn the volume down, so I sit here in this
Chaos and piss, watching the storm passing
Storms are beautiful, right here it's beautiful
I came all this way to be with you, and you're already gone
If I was a good friend, I could right this wrong
I'd kick away your crutches, make you walk on your own
I really thought you'd be here, I just don't get it
Though it looks warm in the rabbit hole, I could go down with you
Even though I want to, I want to, I won't
I don't feel like calming down, no I don't
I don't feel like hiding out, so I won't
I can't turn this volume down, so I sit here in this
Chaos and piss, watching the storm passing
It's beautiful
I'm a willow tree, you can't blow me over
And my roots go deep in anger
I wanna feel the wind as it whips me like a prisoner
I wanna be here
I wanna be here
I don't feel like calming down, no I don't
I don't feel like hiding out, so I won't
I can't turn the volume down, so I sit here in this
Chaos and piss, watching the storm passing
Storms are beautiful, this life is beautiful
It is
