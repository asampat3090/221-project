Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again
Ooh, you're the light that feeds the sun in my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
Uh, the only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, woah, I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, with out you I'm lost
Can't face this focus at heart between me and love
You're the common denominator, oh, oh, ooh, oh
You're the common denominator, oh, yeah, woah
Before your love was low, now you're just my height, aye
We chase the game that would put my card at the side.
Broken heart rise up to say love is alive
You and I would stand to be multiplied, yeah
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
Uh, the only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, woah, I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, with out you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart between me and love
You're the common denominator, oh, oh, ooh, oh
You're the common denominator, oh, yeah, woah
I'm never ever not without your touch
Every kiss that you give, it gives me heart
And to all the heart it can
Jealous females hate it, I'ma hold it down for you
For you, woah, oh woah
Common denominator, oh, yeah, woah
I don't wanna to go back
Half of the equation, woah, woah, yeah
Common denominator, oh, oh, oh, oh
Common denominator, oh, yeah, woah
Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I'd fall in love with you all over again, yeah
