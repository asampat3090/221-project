You give me life like lots of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go
And it's you I miss, and it's you I miss
So let it out, let it out, now
I let it out, I let it out now, now
You speak me to me behind your darkening stare,
And you let me be as if I wasn't there
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue
It's you I miss and it's you I miss
So let it out, let it out, now
I let it out, I let it out, now, now
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn part, you see we were just like glue
We're like glue
So let it out, let it out, now
Let it out, let it out, now, now
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue
