hiphop
Nice legs, Daisy Dukes makes a man go
That's the way they all come through like
Low cut, see through shirts that make ya
That's the way she come through like
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
I think I should know
How to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
How do I say I'm sorry
'Cause the word is just never gonna come out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
Tight jeans, double D's makin' me go
All the people on the street know
Iced out, lit up make the kids go
All the people on the street know
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
I think I should know
How to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
How do I say I'm sorry
'Cause the word is just never gonna come out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow
Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
This is the same old dance that you already know
Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow
Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
This is the same old dance that you already know
I think I should know
How to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
