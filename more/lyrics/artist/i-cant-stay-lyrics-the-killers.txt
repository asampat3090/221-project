rock
The emotion, it was electric
And the stars, they all aligned
I knew I had to make my decision
But I never made the time
No, I never made the time
In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay so far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home
Exoneration lost his eraser
But my forgiver found the sun
And there are twisted days that I take comfort
'Cause I'm not the only one
No, I'm not the only one
In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay very far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home
There is a majesty at my doorstep
And there is a little boy in her arms
Now we'll parade around without game plans
Obligation or alarm
In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay very far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home
In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay so far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home, in the dark
