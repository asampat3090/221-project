Just lay your head in daddy's lap, you're a bad girl (bad girl)
One, two, three, four
Hey, hey, I'll let you walk all over me (me)
You know that I'm a little tease (tease)
But I want it pretty please (please)
You know (you know x2) I'm crazy
I just want to be your baby
You can fuck me, you can play me
You can love me, you can hate me
Miss me, miss me
Now you want to kiss me
Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know
(don't tell me what to do)
Come get it, now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl, here we go
(one, two, three, four)
Miss me, miss me
Now you want to kiss me
(Mmmm you're a bad girl)
Baby, you know I want a little taste (taste)
So let me take you all the way (way)
You know you'll never be the same (same)
(You fuckin' bad girl)
One night, you won't forget the rest of your life
So come on over to the wild side
Buckle up and baby hold on tight
Miss me, miss me
Now you want to kiss me
We both know that you love me 'cause I'm so bad
Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know
(don't tell me what to do)
Come get it, now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl, here we go
(one, two, three, four)
(I've been a bad girl 7x)
(a fuckin bad girl)
Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I've been a bad girl, don't you know
(don't tell me what to do)
Come get it, now or never
I'll let you do whatever
I'll be your bad girl, here we go
(one, two, three, four)
