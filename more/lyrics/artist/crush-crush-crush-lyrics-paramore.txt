Paramore
rock
I got a lot to say to you, yeah, I got a lot to say
I notice your eyes are always glued to me
You're keeping them here and it makes no sense at all
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
Crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush
(Two, three, four!)
Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than this
If you want to play it like a game
Well, come on, come on, let's play
'Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending
Than have to forget you for one whole minute
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
Crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush
(Two, three, four!)
Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than this now
Rock and roll, baby, don't you know
That we're all alone now? I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, honey, don't you know, baby
We're all alone now? I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, hey, don't you know, baby
We're all alone now? Give me something to sing about
Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, no!
Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, more than this, oh
