rock
You know you could've been a wonder
Takin' your circus to the sky
You couldn't take it on the tight rope
No you had to take it on the side
You always like it undercover
Tucked in between your dirty sheets
But no one's even done nuttin' to ya
In between the hollers and the screams
And I said nah nah hey hey
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night till the red morning light
You got your cozy little corner
All night you're jammin' on your feet
Hangin' out just like a street sign
And put a twenty dollar trick
I hear you're blowin' like a feather
And then they rub it in your face
Oh once they've had all their fun hun
You're at the bottom of the cage
And I said nah nah hey hey
Another dirty bird ain't giving out a taste
In the black of the night till the red morning light
And I said nah nah hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away
That's not right
Hey hey another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
Uh hey keep on givin' away and givin' it away (givin' it away)
Hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away
Hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away
