Drake
hiphop
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion
endlessly , I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
[Hook: Drake]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
[Hook: Drake]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby
You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
