pop
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh [x18]
Remember make believe in you
All the things I said I'd do
I wouldn't hurt you, like the world did me
Keep you safe, I'd keep you sweet
Everything that I went through,
I'm grateful you won't have to do
I know that you will have to fall
I can't hide you from it all
[Chorus]
But take the best of what I've got
And you know no matter what
Before you walk away, you know you can
Run, run, run,
Back to my arms, back to my arms
Run, run, run, back to my arms and they will hold you down
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh [x4]
See, here's the bloody, bloody truth
You will hurt and you will lose
I've got scars you won't believe
Wear them proudly on my sleeve
I hope you'll have the sense to know
That sadness comes and sadness goes
Love so hard and play life loud
It's the only thing to give a damn about
[Chorus]
But take the best of what I've got
And you know no matter what
Before you walk away, you know you can
Run, run, run,
Back to my arms, back to my arms
Run, run, run,
Back to my arms and they will hold you down
All this time I swear I'll never waste it
All your smiles I'm always gonna save them
Put it in the back of my mind
Whenever I'm away from you [x2]
Run, run, run
Back to your arms, back to your arms
Run, run, run
Back your arms and they will hold you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Back to my arms, back to my arms
All this time I swear I'll never waste it
All your smiles I'm always gonna save them
Put it in the back of my mind
Back to my arms, and they will hold you down
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh [x2]
They will hold you down
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh [x2]
