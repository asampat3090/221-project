Me not working hard?
Yeah, right, picture that with a Kodak
Or better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all to know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-yo, Tesra
Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight
Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love
(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Get busy tonight
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to do battle, perform for princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless
It's insane to wait and they ain't growin' money
Keep flowin', hustlers move beside us
So I'm tip-toeing to keep blowing
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan
Put it on my lap, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight
Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow
Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight
Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handled love
(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab them, at least you're on top of the world
Think about it
'Cause if you slip, I'm gonna fall on top of your girl
When I'm involved, it goes deeper than them aces
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My family is from Cuba, but I'm an American Idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest
Put it on my light, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight
Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow
Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight
Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love
(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow
