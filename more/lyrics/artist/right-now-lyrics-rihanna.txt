Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
Cause all we got is Right Now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
Cause all we got is Right Now
Baby tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go
Whenever baby i'm yours
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
Cause all we got is Right Now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
Cause all we got is Right Now
Cause all we got is Right Now....
So close I can taste you
Ain't scared I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Got me feel feeling
You got me feeling
Something you wanted to do all your life
There's no more waiting tonight is the night
And it can't be wrong not if it feels this right
Turn it up, scream it loud, yeah
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
Cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
Cause all we got is right now
Cause all we got is right now....
