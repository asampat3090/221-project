Gonna stay in bed today
'Cuz I can't stand the light
Don't know why I get so down
I won't be much fun tonight
And I can't believe
You still want to hang around me
It's not so pretty all the time
You don't mind
To you it's alright
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him
I'm not the girl you think you see
But maybe that's a lie
You almost know me better than
Me, myself and I
Don't know a lot of things
But I know what I got
It's not so perfect everyday
I don't have to try
'Cuz it all falls into place
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him
Face to face, eye to eye
You're standing there
Feels good on the inside
I don't mind, I don't care
You're standing there
Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the pieces missing
I'm looking at him
Found the pieces missing
Take me as I am
When I talk you listen
Take me as I am
Found the pieces missing
Take me as I am
