pop
I saw your face, stuck in a crowd
Silently screaming out loud
I felt the beat echo your heart
Throw me a line cuz its too far
All that you want, all that you see
All that you thought that you believe
Is it enough? Do you think its too much?
You say you only trust what you can touch
All you got to do is reach out for it
All that you want
Is standing right in front of you
All that you need
Is love....
All that you want
Is standing right in front of you
All that you need
Is love...
Walk to the ledge, put out my hands
Scared to the bones of where I'd land
Trade in my fears, trade in my faults
They disappear behind your walls
All that i want, all that i need
All that i thought i believed
Was it enough? Sure not too much?
Now youre the only thing that i can trust
All i got to do is reaach out for it
All that you want
Is standing right in front of you
All that you need
Is love....
All that you want
Is standing right in front of you
All that you need
Is love...
(Instrumental)
Its all for you...
Its all for you...
