rock
Running with the street lights
Laughing at the grave
He swears he's gonna give it up
It's never gonna be enough
I just wanna be there
When you're all alone
Thinking about a better day
When you had it in your bones
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
I see you in the evening
Sitting on your throne
You're praying with a fireball
And post it up against the wall
I just wanna hold you
Take you by your hand
And tell you that you're good enough
And tell you that it's gonna be tough
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
'Cause I ain't got a home
Running from the streetlights
Shining on her grave
Once you had the good stuff
Never gonna fill you up
I wanna be the one who
Gives them my world
And gives them all the feeling of it
Just a little taste of it
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
'Cause I ain't got a home
I-I'll forever roam
No, I ain't got a home
I'll forever roam
'Cause I ain't got a home
I'll forever roam
No, I ain't got a home
I'll forever roam
I ain't got a home
