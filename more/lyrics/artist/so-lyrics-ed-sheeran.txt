Filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you wont remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
I see your grace
From my window
When it is late at night
Itll show me your shadow
Im in my place
Hope you remember
When summers gone
Ill still sing a song
Of you in September
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
These words I say mean
Youre so amazing
Ive noticed lately
I need you, maybe
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
