Give it to mama
Give it, give it
Give it to mama, mama
Give it
Give it to mama, mama
For some strange reason
You done pleasin' me like it's okay
Like a perm that's been left too long
It's starts to burn, the result is it just won't take
(I can see)
Now it's all coming so clear to me now
(I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you than I can't do
My stock just went up over 2 million
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
Give it to mama
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
Some see me say I should be trophied
'Cause it gets no stronger
Ladies y'all know, yeah, girl y'all know
This pimp *ish gets no older
Is that a threat? What's another threat?
Yep, that's another threat, from you, you can get no colder
You got the green light, you lookin' right
You holdin' up traffic, green means go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
(I said you're holdin' up traffic, green means go!)
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
Give it to mama
(Go, go, go, go)
Ain't no problem, you can go
I'm gon' find somebody else
(Go, go, go, go)
So why not move along?
You got the green light so you can go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
I gave all I could give
To my love, my heart
Now we're facing the end
Of what you did from the start, my love
You're holdin' up traffic, green means go!
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
Give it to mama
(Go, go, go, go)
Ain't no problem, you can go
I'm gon' find somebody else
(Go, go, go, go)
So why not move along?
You got the green light so you can go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
