Coldplay
rock
And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part
And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start
I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh and I, I wish that I could work it out
And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh
And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh
I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
The silver lining the clouds
Oh and I, oh and I
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about
Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart
Oh and it's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
