pop
Midnight rush with a pen in my hand
Inkin Lincoln, sand-script with a fan
Remembering me before it began
Sometimes I felt so def in the jam
'Cause the ones who loved me told me to stop
Like home girl can't catch shit if it drops
A superwoman chick you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to someone
Who's got the flavor but don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business, not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta, uh, oh
Don't want no paper gangsta, uh, oh
Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your range rover heart?
I've heard it before, yeah, the dinners were nice
Till your diamond words melted into some ice
You should been rapping to the beat of my song Mr. California
Paper gangsta and I'm lookin' for love
Not an empty page full of stuff that means nothing
But, "you've been played"
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous
