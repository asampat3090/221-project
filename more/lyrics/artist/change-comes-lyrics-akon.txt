Hanging around outside the club
Wishing everyone knew he was
But that day soon comes
Steady trying to get some love
No one cares when you ain't got none
When you get it they all come
They'll say you won't make it.
Judge you from your past
They'll say that you are nothing
You was raised way too fast
Even say you can't take it
Your success won't last
But let me tell you something, yeah
Don't you believe them
'Cause that's just the way it is
We're gonna change that tonight
Some things will never change
We're gonna change that tonight
'Cause that's just the way it is
We're gonna change that tonight
Never felt so alive
Like I do tonight
I've got this feeling in my heart
That it's all gonna change
Up against all odds
And still we own the night
I've got that feeling in my heart
That it's all gonna change here tonight
So toast it up, toast it up.
If you've got that feeling that it's all gonna change here tonight
So toast it up, toast it up.
If you've got that feeling that it's all gonna change
Just sing
(Vocalizing)
Met a girl who was once in love
And never thought she'd be alone
But that day soon comes
Her boyfriend left her for another
Now she's pregnant with his son
She ain't the only one
Going through rough times
Under the city nights
Even sold her body to keep on the lights
Searching for that love
Her daddy didn't provide
She found a pimp and he's that guy
Smacked her up and told her
She won't make it
Judged her from her past
Told her that she was nothing
She was raised way too fast
Even say she can't take it
Her success won't last
But let me tell you something, yeah
Don't you believe them
'Cause that's just the way it is
We're gonna change that tonight
Some things will never change
We're gonna change that tonight
'Cause that's just the way it is
We're gonna change that tonight
Never felt so alive
Like I do tonight
I've got this feeling in my heart
That it's all gonna change
Up against all odds
And still we own the night
I've got that feeling in my heart
That it's all gonna change here tonight
So toast it up, toast it up.
If you've got that feeling that it's all gonna change here tonight
So toast it up, toast it up.
If you've got that feeling that it's all gonna change
Just sing
