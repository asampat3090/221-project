Come come my dear, take flight, come near
I see your fear creeping around you
First love then hate, then love, no wait
Your confusion, it's gonna kill me
I broke for you, I woke for you
You tore me through, god love you
I see the signs are out of line
No fault of mine except for
Don't say his name now
I'm breaking out, something ain't right here
You've fallen out, something ain't right here
You screamed, I begged, what's that you said?
Your clouded head's telling you lies now
You hear my voice, you make some noise
You stole my choice it's over
And I pray for you now
I speak to you
I'm breaking out, something ain't right here
You've fallen out, something ain't right here
I'm breaking out, something ain't right here
You've fallen out, fallen out for
Fallen out, you've fallen out!
Why can't you see it?
I'll pray for you now
I'm speaking to
