I see the way you move and I picture you nude
Baby keep movin' that thing, baby keep movin' that thing
I wanna take you to the boom boom room
So we can do it like boom, boom, boom, boom
Pleasure, yes, God bless
I love my women rated triple-X
Let me show you how we do it 'round here
Man the women they don't fake it they get naked down here
It's da bottom, no bras no drawers
Da bottom, where they holla "Take it off!"
Da bottom, where we turn out daughters
Just to plan a lick on the father, we got 'em

Where them schools got classics like Jay-Z's "Reasonable Doubt
Pit is always reppin' for them boyz up the road
For them boyz on the block yellin' "We base blow"
