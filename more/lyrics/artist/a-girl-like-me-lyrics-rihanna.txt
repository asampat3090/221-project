Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' new to say
Don't they realize
It's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole worlds turnin' left
It's when I'm goin' right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside
'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
Would give me anything if I asked him to
To take all my dreams and then make 'em true
Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
With a girl like me
Just like me
Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you want to take
A chance on something real
'Cause a girl like me
(Girl like me)
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best
(Never gonna settle)
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked him to
(If I asked him to)
To take all my dreams and then make 'em true
Show me all the reasons you ought to be
With a girl like me
(Like me)
Just like me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
(Before I fall)
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
When the whole world's turnin' left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside
'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest

(Girl like me)
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you

Would give me anything if I asked him to
To take all my dreams and then make 'em true

Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
