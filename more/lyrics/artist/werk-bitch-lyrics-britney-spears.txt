You wanna

[Chorus]
You wanna hot body
You want a bugatti
You wanna maseratti
You better work bitch
You want a lamborghini
Sip martinis
Look hot in a bikini
You better work bitch
You wanna live fancy
Live in a big mansion
Party in France
You better work bitch
You better work bitch
You better work bitch
Now get to work bitch

Now get to work bitch

[Verse 1]
Bring it on
Ring the alarm
Don't stop now
Just be the champion
Working hard like it's your profession
Watch out now
'Cause here it comes
Here comes the smasher
Here comes the master
Here comes the beat, beat
Beat beat to get ya
Now time to quit now
Just time to get it now
Pick up what I'm letting down
Pick up what I'm letting down
[Chorus]
You wanna hot body
You want a bugatti
You wanna maseratti
You better work bitch!
You want a lamborghini
Sip martinis
Look hot in a bikini
You better work bitch!
You wanna live fancy
Live in a big mansion
Party in France
You better work bitch
You better work bitch
You better work bitch
Now get to work bitch
(ahhhh)
Now get to work bitch
(ahhhh)
[Verse 2]
Break it on
Break it down
See me coming
You can hear my sound
Tell somebody in your town
Spread the word
Spread the word
Go call the police
Go call the governor
I bring the trouble
That means the trouble's on
I make the governor
Call me the governor
I am the bad bitch
The bad bitch you'll never know
[Bridge]
Hold your hands high
Fingers to the sky
They gon' try to try ya
But they can't deny ya
Keep it building higher and higher
Keep it building higher and higher
So hold your head high
Fingers to the sky
Now they don't believe ya
But they gonna need ya
Keep it building higher and higher
Keep it building higher and higher
Work work work....
Work it out work it out...
You better work bitch
You better work bitch
