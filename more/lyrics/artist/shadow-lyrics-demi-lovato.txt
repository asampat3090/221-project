I glanced upon the ground today I noticed something,
It followed me
Along the way, a figure of gray,
Impersonating everymove I make
For now we'll call it my shadow,
And it said will you replace it,
So you'll be with me every where I go...
Sentences of yours,
Running throughout my head,
Searching for a chance
To catch my breath,
A never-ending dream,
You'll become a part of me,
Day or night,
Dark or light you'll be,
Taking over that thing called my
Shadow
And what happens on the days when,
The clouds appear and fade away my
Shade, oh, that's our cue babe,
We'll run away to a place where the sun
Always shines
That not even time could erase,
You're my weakness babe but you give me
Strength, I need you,
I need you like the blood in my veins.
Sentences of yours,
Running throughout my head,
Searching for a chance
To catch my breath,
A never-ending dream,
You'll become a part of me,
Day or night, dark or light you'll be,
Taking over that thing called my
Shadow
