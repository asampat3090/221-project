Hush, hush
Shhh
Hush, hush
I didn't mean to kiss you
You didn't mean to fall in love
I never meant to hurt you
We never meant for it to mean this much
Hush, hush now
I wanted to keep you
Forever next to me
You know that I still do
And all I wanted was to believe
Hush, hush now
So go on, live your life
So go on, say goodbye
So many questions but I don't ask why
So this time I won't even try
Hush, hush now
Hush, hush now
When I try to forget you
I just keep on remembering
What we had was so true
But somehow we lost everything
Hush, hush now
(Hush, hush now)
(Chorus)
So go on, live your life
So go on, say goodbye
So many questions but I don't ask why
So go on, live your life
So go on and say goodbye
So many questions but I don't ask why
Maybe someday but not tonight
Hush, hush now
(Hush, hush now) (x2)
Don't, don't, don't you ever say a word, word
Of what you ever thought you heard, heard
Don't you ever tell a soul
But you know
I tried to hide, but I still believe
We, that we were always meant to be, be
But I can never let you go, no
Hush, hush now
(Chorus)
So go on, live your life
So go on, say goodbye
So many questions but I don't ask why
So go on, live your life
So go on, and say goodbye
So many questions but I don't ask why
Maybe someday but not tonight
Hush, hush now
Hush, hush now
Hush hush...
