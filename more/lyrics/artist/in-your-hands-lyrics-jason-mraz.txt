rock
Ticket lines, and places to dine
Taking baths and drinkin' wine
People ask I say I'm doin' fine
Motorcycles and for sure The Eiffel Tower
They were made for two
A double bed has never felt so empty
What's missing in the world is you
So I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I like climbing the mountain
Or climbing back in the bed
I love making breakfast
For someone instead of me
Taking autumn walks in Central Park
They were made for two
Afternoon naps have never felt so crappy
What's missing in my life is you
So I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'm gonna it in your hands now
To come through
Its like diving into a pool without water
And praying for rain
Well, my life is a good life anyway
What I have will do
But when you're alone
You're living in a world with only choices
And what I choose is you
So I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'll leave it in your hands now
To come through
I'm gonna it in your hands now
To come through
