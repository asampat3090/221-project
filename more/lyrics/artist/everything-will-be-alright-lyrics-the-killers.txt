rock
I believe in you and me
I'm coming to find you
If it takes me all night
Wrong until you make it right
And I won't forget you
At least I'll try
And run, and run tonight
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
I wasn't shopping for a doll
To say the least, I thought I've seen them all
But then you took me by surprise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
So take your suitcase, 'cause I don't mind
And baby doll, I meant it every time
You don't need to compromise
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
But it's alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Will be alright
