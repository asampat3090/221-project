Like a stone you watch it fall
And let it roll out over the fields
You take your time and watch it crawl
Like you're the big shot symphony
But oh what would you say if I told you 'the pitch is wrong' with a smile?
I took a trip to wonderland,
Gonna get you nowhere by a mile
I,
I could light it up for you
I,
I could light it up for you
We
We ain't got a shot to lose
Put it on but fade it out
Tell you that you weren't enough
Acting like your favourite drug
Raise a cup
We can light it up
I took a shot and missed the mark
Well every single day I multiply
A million drums of kerosene
Baby, like a hotel in the sky
I just want to see
All the sparks you're trying to hide
Let's take a trip to wonderland
We can just tune this fire tonight
I,
I could light it up for you
I,
I could light it up for you
We
We ain't got a shot to lose
Put it on but fade it out
Tell you that you weren't enough
Acting like your favourite drug
Raise a cup
We can light it up
We can light it up
