Hey Mr. Curiosity
Is it true what they've been saying about you
Well are you killing me
You took care of the cat already
And for those who think it's heavy
Is it the truth
Or is it only gossip
Call it mystery or anything
Oh just as long as you call me
I sent the message on did you get it when I left it
Said well this catastrophic event
It wasn't meant to mean no harm
But to think there's nothing wrong is a problem, oh
I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
(Trying not to ask why)
This love is a mystery
Mr. Curious...
Come back to me
I'm a mr. waiting on and never patient can't you see
That I'm the same the way you left me, left me
In a hurry to spell check me
And I'm underlined already in envy green
And pencil red
And I've forgotten what you've said
Will you stop working for the dead and return
A mr. curious well I need some inspiration
It's my birthday and I cannot find no cause for celebration
The scenario is grave but I'll be braver when you save me
From this situation laden with hearsay, oh
I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
(Trying not to ask why)
This love is a mystery
Mr. Curiosity
Hey mr. please
Do come and find me, oh
Oh, come on oh, yea yea
I'm looking for love this time
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
(Trying not to ask why)
Cause love is a mystery
Mr. curiosity
Hey mr. please
Do come and find me
Love is blinding when your timing's never right
Oh but who am I to beg for difference
Finding love in a distant instant
But I don't mind
Oh love at least I tried, well I tried...
