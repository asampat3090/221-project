SPOKEN:
Speakin' of Christmas spirit,
Each year, out in Hollywood, California,
They have what they call the Santa Claus parade
A few years ago, while I was riding in this parade
I saw smiles on thousands of faces
Both young and old alike
Waitin' for a look at that most popular man all over the world
I can hear 'em shoutin' now
Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus,
Here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane,
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pullin' on the reins.
Bells are ringin', children singin',
All is merry and bright.
So hang your stockings and say your prayers,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
Here comes Santa Claus,
Here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane,
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again.
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,
Oh what a beautiful sight,
So jump in bed, and cover your head,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
[musical interlude]
Here comes Santa Claus,
Here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane,
He'll come around when chimes ring out,
It's Christmas time again.
Peace on earth will come to all,
If we just follow the light,
So let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
Here comes Santa Claus,
Here comes Santa Claus,
Right down Santa Claus Lane,
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pullin' on the reins.
Bells are ringin', children singin',
All is merry and bright,
So jump in bed, and cover your head,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
[musical interlude]
Peace on earth will come to all,
If we just follow the light,
So let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight,
So let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
