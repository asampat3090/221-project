Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy, oh don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Mrs.
And daddy won't you treat him right
Now that you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give ya fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give ya fever when ya kiss 'em
Fever if you live ya learn
Fever until you sizzle
