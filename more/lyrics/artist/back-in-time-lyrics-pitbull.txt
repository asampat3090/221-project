Pitbull
pop
Let's excuse me baby
Go, Yeah you baby
Back, Ooh you groovy baby
In, let's make a movie baby
Time, excuse me baby
Let's, yeah you baby
Go, Ooh you groovy baby
Back in, let's make a movie baby, Time
It's Mr Worldwide, Agent A, Reporting live
From Cape Canaveral, MK, Big Syphe
Let's ride
Back, Back, In, In, Time
Baby
Ohh baby, Ohh baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
Miami equals black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie
I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K
And I wish the whole world would
Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
Im a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture
Bury a boarder, record-breaker wont cha
Give credit where credit is due dont cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time
Baby
Ohh baby, Ohh baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
I got the globe,
Yeah! In the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Lets save the world
Men In Black I know you understand
Stop the movement (Hahah)
They can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, Si
They can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, Id bet it all
And fought blind against the world
Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time
Baby, ohhh baby
Ohhh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one
Let's excuse me baby
Go, Yeah you baby
Back, Ooh you groovy baby
In, let's make a movie baby
Time, excuse me baby
Let's, yeah you baby
Go, Ooh you groovy baby
Back in, let's make a movie baby, Time
Baby
Ohh baby, Ohh baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
