Something told me
It was over
When I saw you
And her talking
Something deep
Down
In my soul said
"Cry Girl"
When I saw you
And that girl
Walking around
(woo)
I would rather
I would rather
Go blind boy
Than to see you
Walk away
From me child
(Woo,Woo)
So you see
I love you
So much
That I don't want
To watch you
Leave me baby
Most of all
I just don't
I just don't want
To be free no,no.
(woo)
I was just
I was just
I was just
Sitting here
Thinking
Of your kiss
And your
Warm embrace
Yeah
When
A reflection
In the glass
That I held
To my lips now
Baby
Revealed
The tears
That are
On my face
And baby, baby
I would rather
Be blind boy
Than to see you
Walk away
See you
Walk away
From me, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
I'd rather be
Blind
