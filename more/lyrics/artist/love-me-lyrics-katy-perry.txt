I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do
But I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me
But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found that I had to love myself, the way I want you to love me
No more second guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonly
I'm gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me
Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip, and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you are in love, in love with
So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They're gonna have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself, the way I want you to love me
No more second guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonly
I'm gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me
No more standing in my own way
Let's get deeper, let's get closer
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)
No more standing in my own way
Let's get deeper, let's get closer
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)
No more second guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing my feelings, or changing seasonly
I'm gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me
No more second guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonly
I'm gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me
