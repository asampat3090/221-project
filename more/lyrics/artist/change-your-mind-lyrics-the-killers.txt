rock
Racy days help me through the hopeless haze
But my oh my
Tragic eyes, that I can't even recognize
Myself behind
So if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
Out again, a siren screams at half past ten
And you won't let go
While I ignore, that we both felt like this
Before it starts to show
So if I have a chance
Would you let me know?
Why aren't you shaking?
Step back in time
Graciously taking
Oh you're too kind
And if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
We're all the same
And love is blind
The sun is gone
Before it shines
And I said, if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
And if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
