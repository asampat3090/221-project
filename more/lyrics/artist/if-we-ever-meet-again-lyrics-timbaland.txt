Timbaland
hiphop
What's somebody like you, doing in a place like this?
Say, did you come alone, or did you bring all your friends?
Say, what's your name, what you drinking
I think I know what you're thinking
Baby what's your sign, tell me yours I'll tell you mine
Say, what's somebody like you doing in a place like this?
(1, 2, 3, 4)
CHORUS:
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - said if we ever meet again
This free fall's, got me so
Kiss me all night don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same
If we ever meet again
Say if we ever meet again
Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before (before, yeah)
Hope you don't see me blush, but I can't help but want you more, more
Baby tell me what's your story
I ain't shy, don't you worry
I'm flirtin with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight
So do you come here much, I gotta see your face some more, some more
'Cause baby
CHORUS:
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - said if we ever meet again
This free fall's, got me so
Kiss me all night don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same
If we ever meet again
If we ever meet again
I'll have so much more to say (if we ever meet again)
If we ever meet again
I won't let you go away (said if we ever meet again)
If we ever ever meet again
I'll have so much more to say (say if we ever meet again)
If we ever ever meet again
I won't let you go away
CHORUS:
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - said if we ever meet again
This free fall's, got me so
Kiss me all night don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same
If we ever meet again
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - said if we ever meet again
This free fall's, got me so
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same
If we ever meet again
