Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had
Everything and no less
Didn't I do it right?
Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to
Having me around
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road
Without me right here
But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back
At this crumbling and fool
Just take it all
With my love
Take it all
With my love
Maybe I should leave
To help you see
Nothing is better than this
And this is everything we need
So is it over?
Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this
But go on, go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all
With my love
Take it all
With my love
I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh, if only, if only you knew
Everything I do is for you
But go on, go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool
Just take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all
With my love
Take it all
With my love
Take it all
With my love
