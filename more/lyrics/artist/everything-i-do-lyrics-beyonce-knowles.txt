Come on
Every step I make and every breath I take
I took 'cause I can't wait to be closer to you
Baby you're so sweet you give me cavities
I get a stomach ache if I can't be with you
At night I fall asleep and I don't wanna wake up
'Cause you are in my dreams a heavenly creation
In the body that I only wanna share with you
Hey
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait to give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Baby we will never finish
To be continued
Separation can't change
The love I feel for you
I'm gonna definitely be affectionate
Snuggle up tonight let's get real intimate
'Cause only you can satisfy my appetite
'Cause when it comes to love
You get me get so excited
I wanna taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait to give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait to give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
You are my
Universe
Everything I want and
Everything I need and
Everything worth waiting for
For, for better or for worse
Constant craving
Your love enslaves me
Oh
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait to give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Oh, I wanna give it to you, baby
Give it to me baby
I wanna give it to you, baby
Oh, give it to me baby
I can't wait
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
I can't wait
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
I can't wait to give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
