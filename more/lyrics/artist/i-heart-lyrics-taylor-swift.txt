Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I created
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue
But boy, you ask me if I'm all right
Think about what I had to do, yeah
Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an 'I Heart'
Written on the back of my hand
I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me sit at home
Cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night
And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to
Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an 'I Heart'
Written on the back of my hand
And when you're home all alone at night
You still wonder why
You took everything I had away
But I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will
Wake up and smell the break-up
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an 'I Heart'
Written on the back of my hand
Written on the back of my hand
An "I Heart?"
Yeah, written on the back of my hand
