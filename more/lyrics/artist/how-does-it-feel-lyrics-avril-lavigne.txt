I'm not afraid of anything
I just need to know that I can breathe
And I don't need much of anything
But suddenly, suddenly
I am small and the world is big
All around me is fast moving
Surrounded by so many things
Suddenly, suddenly
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?
I am young and I am free
But I get tired and I get weak
I get lost and I can't sleep
But suddenly, suddenly
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?
Would you comfort me?
Would you cry with me?
I am small and the world is big
But I'm not afraid of anything
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
You're different from me, different
