(PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'm a put you down
(PYD, PYD, PYD)
Down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'm a put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down
[Justin Bieber:]
From the door to the wall
Coffee table, girl, get ready
I'm a put you down (PYD PYD PYD)
All the way down (PYD PYD PYD)
From the stove to the counter top
Dining room table, are you ready?
I'm a put you down
(PYD PYD PYD, PYD PYD PYD)
Up the stairs to my bedroom,
Light a few candles, brace yourself
I'm a put you down (PYD PYD PYD)
All the way down (PYD PYD PYD)
On a plane, a train, an automobile doesn't matter
I'm a put you down (PYD PYD PYD)
All the way down (PYD PYD PYD)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And it don't make no sense to be that bad
I'm a take it down on you, babe (PYD PYD PYD)
Put you down (PYD PYD PYD)
This will show you how much I love you
For my appreciation
I'm a put you down (PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD)
Ooh, 'cause you deserve the best
And nothing but the best
So I give you the best you've ever had
I'm a put you down (PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD)
I'm a put you down
[R. Kelly:]
On the roof, balcony, we don't care who sees
Girl, I'm a put you down (PYD PYD PYD)
All way down, down, down (PYD PYD PYD)
After the club, in the parking lot
I don't care anyone who could pick the spot, whatever
I'm a put you down, yea (PYD PYD PYD)
All way down, yeah (PYD PYD PYD)
'Cause I've been doing forensics
On your body in this club
Now I can tell the way you walk banned
Ain't been touched the right way
It seems your man been treating you like a step child
Some of 'em are out, some are in
And I'm a get on the floor
And shut the whole game down
Until I hear you cheering, babe
Have you spelled out my name, babe
See, I wanna give you all my love
Be your dope man in the bedroom
You can make me your drug, babe
[Chorus: R. Kelly]
And it don't make no sense to be that bad
Oh no, baby (PYD PYD PYD),
I'm a put you down
Gonna show you how much I love you
For my appreciation, yeah no ooh
(PYD PYD PYD, PYD PYD PYD)
Ooh, 'cause you deserve the best
And nothing but the best
So I give you the best you've ever had
I'm gonna put you down (PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD)
I'm gonna put you down, all the way down
[Both:]
Ooh, 'cause you deserve the best
And nothing but the best
So I give you the best you've ever had
I'm a put you down, I'm a put you down, I'm a put you down
I'm a put you down, I'm a put you down, I'm a put you down
Put you down, put you down, put you down, put you down down
Put you down, put you down, put you down, put you down down
I'm a put you down
Put you down, put you down, put you down, put you down down
All the way down
Put you down, put you down, put you down, put you down down
PYD, PYD, PYD PYD PYD PYD
I'm a put you down
PYD PYD PYD PYD PYD
