It feels like we've been out at sea, oh
So back and forth that's how it seems, whoa
And when I want to talk, you say to me
That if it's meant to be, it will be, whoa, whoa
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water and I
I'm overboard and I need your love, pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Lifesaver, oh, lifesaver
My lifesaver
Lifesaver, oh, lifesaver
Whoa, wow
Never understood you when you said, whoa
Wanted me to meet you halfway, whoa
I felt like I was doing my part
You kept thinking you're coming up short
It's funny how things change 'cause now I see
Oh, whoa, whoa
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for ya
Got me out here in the water and I
I'm overboard and I need your love, pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver, oh
It's supposed to be some give and take, I know
But you're only taking and not given any more
So what do I do? 'Cause I still love you
You're the only one who can save me, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, I'm overboard and I need your love, pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Lifesaver, oh, lifesaver
My lifesaver
It's crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah
Lifesaver, oh, lifesaver
Oh, lifesaver, oh, lifesaver
My lifesaver
Lifesaver, oh, lifesaver
Yeah
