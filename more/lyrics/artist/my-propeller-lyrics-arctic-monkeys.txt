rock
If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your decent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys
Coax me out, my love
And have a spin of my propeller
It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrow the beak of a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy
Coax me out, my love
Sink into tomorrow
Coax me out, my love
And have a spin of my propeller
My propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving? My propeller
