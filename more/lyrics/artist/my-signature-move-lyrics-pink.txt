Pink
pop
I've got a way of making everything a confrontation
And you've got a way, of bringing out the worst in me
You see, it's just if I'm bored
I found a way to make an accusation
I've got a problem with more
So give me, give me everything
STOP!
Not my fault, not at all
I can't help you what you want
Get in line, take a number
Get you when my song is over
If you leave it up to me I'll make a lie out of the truth (it's true)
And then I'll break it up, make it bleed
Tell you that it's you not me
Make a scene, add a show, just because the wind blows
Shoot myself in the foot to make a point I can't prove
To get it back to you
That's just my signature move
You call me cra-zy and I think it's mean I just don't like it
I'm just a sensitive babe and you need to please me right
You know I said I would change
I did, I went and tried a different outfit
And if that's not enough, you won't be ridin' dirty tonight
STOP!
Not my fault, not at all
I can't help you what you want
Get in line, take a number
Get you when my song is over
If you leave it up to me I'll make a lie out of the truth (it's true)
And then I'll break it up, make it bleed
Tell you that it's you not me
Make a scene, add a show, just because the wind blows
Shoot myself in the foot to make a point I can't prove
To get it back to you
That's just my signature move
That's just my signature move
That's just my signature move
That's just my signature move
I still fight in my dreams, I think I kick off the sheets
I don't apologize you wouldn't see it in my eyes
I'm not a good best friend
If there's a rule I will bend
That makes it trouble for you
It's all I know how to do
I'm not responsib...STOP!
Ha-ha...yup!
Not my fault, not at all
I can't help you what you want
Get in line, take a number
Get you when my song is over
If you leave it up to me I'll make a lie out of the truth (it's true)
And then I'll break it up, make it bleed
Tell you that it's you not me
Make a scene, add a show just because the wind blows
Shoot myself in the foot to make a point I can't prove
To get it back to you
That's just my signature move
