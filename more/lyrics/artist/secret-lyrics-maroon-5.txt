rock
Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh can they keep it
Oh no they can't
Driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Where you at now
I feel around
There you are
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe of beads of sweat
Slowly you say, "I'm not there yet"
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh can they keep it
Oh no they can't
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh but can they keep it
Oh no they can't
