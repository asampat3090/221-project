Everything I want I have
Money, notoriety, rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flash bulbs of your pretty cameras,
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous, baby am I glamorous
Hello, hello!
Can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you wanna see me fall
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver line my heart
But burned into to my brain all these stolen images
Stolen images, baby stolen images
Can you picture this
What a life we could've lived
Hello hello!
Can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you wanna see me fall
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful they all say I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
We were two kids just tryin to get out
Live on the dark side of the american dream
We would stay out late, play our music loud
When we grew up nothing was what it seemed
Hello hello!
Can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you wanna see me fall
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
