I like your smile
I like your vibe
I like your style
But that's not why I love you
And I, I like the way
You're such a star
But that's not why I love you
Hey, do you feel, do you feel me?
Do you feel what I feel too?
Do you need, do you need me?
Do you need me?
You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you
Is you being you, just you
Yeah, the reason I love you
Is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you
I like the way you misbehave
When we get wasted
But that's not why I love you
And how you keep your cool
When I am complicated
But that's not why I love you
Hey, do you feel, do you feel me?
Do you feel what I feel too?
Do you need, do you need me?
Do you need me?
You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
And I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you
Is you being you, just you
Yeah, the reason I love you
Is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you
Even though we didn't make it through
I am always here for you, you
You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you
Is you being you, just you
Yeah, the reason I love you
Is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you
That's why I love you
That's why I love you
