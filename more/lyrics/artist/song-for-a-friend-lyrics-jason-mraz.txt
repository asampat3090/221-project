Well you're magic he said
But don't let it all go to your head
Cuz I bet if you all had it all figured out
Then you'd never get out of bed
No doubt
Of all the thing's that I've read what he wrote me
Is now sounding like the man I was hoping
To be
I Keep on keeping it real
Cause it keeps getting easier, he'll see
He's the reason that I'm laughing
Even if there's no one else
He said, you've got to love yourself
You say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak
But keep your tongue up in your cheek
And if you stumble onto something better remember that it's humble that you seek
You got all the skill you need,
Individuality
You got something
You call it gumption
You call it anything you want
Because when you play the fool now
You're only fooling everyone else
You're learning to love yourself
Yes you are
There's no price to pay
When you give and what you take,
That's why it's easy to thank you
You...
Let's say take a break from the day
And get back to the old garage
Because life's too short anyway
But at least it's better then average
As long as you got me
And I got you
You know we'll got a lot to go around
I'll be your friend
Your other brother
Another love to come and comfort you
And I'll keep reminding
If it's the only thing I ever do
I will always love
I will always love you
Yes you
I will always, always, always, always love
I will always, always love
I will always, always love, love
Climb up over the top.
Survey the state of the soul.
You've got to find out for yourself whether or not you're truly trying.
Why not give it a shot?
Shake it. Take control and inevitably wind up
Find out for yourself all the strengths you have inside of you.
