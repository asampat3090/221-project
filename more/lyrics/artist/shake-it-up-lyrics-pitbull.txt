Baby, you ain't gotta front, shorty 'cause I want you
Baby, you ain't gotta front, shorty 'cause I want you
Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me, baby
You ain't gotta front if you want me, shorty 'cause I want you
Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is come get me, shorty 'cause I want you
Ooh, I wanna show you, ooh, I wanna shake it up
Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is come get me, shorty 'cause I want you
Ooh, I wanna show you, ooh, I wanna shake it up
I'ma tell you my thoughts mami
Then you can tell me, huh, what you think
We can discuss everything
You wanna do baby, over these drinks
You can tell me how you want it
Don't fight it, you can tell me how you like it
I'm Mr. However-You-Want-It
Baby, j-j-jump on it
I ain't here to sell you dreams
Or paint you some pretty pictures
I just wanna get in those jeans
And just like a rivalry, lick ya
Baby, you got me feelin', crazy
Don't worry 'bout these haters
Wait up, wait up, I got room keys
Come see me later
We can fulfill fantasies, so call your girls
Don't be mad at me, excuse me baby, I'm freaky, girl
Sugar check this out, this gon' be a night to remember
I can tell by the way you shake it, aw now
Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is come get me, shorty 'cause I want you
Ooh, I wanna show you, ooh, I wanna shake it up
Now, I'm feelin' a little woozy
It's like the room's spinnin' and movin'
I feel her body next to mine
And I'm so fucked up, it's like I'm blind
All I feel is her throwin' it back
And I'm lovin' that
I'm so caught up in the moment
Ain't no holdin' back, never that
Mami, ain't on E
But I got her eyes rollin' back
Mami, it's all on me
Let me show you how to play wit that
Now please, let me show you a freak's technique
I know that you're a freak, you're just discreet
Sugar check this out, this gon' be a night to remember
I can tell by the way you shake it, aw now
Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is come get me, shorty 'cause I want you
Ooh, I wanna show you, ooh, I wanna shake it up
Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is come get me, shorty 'cause I want you
Ooh, I wanna show you, ooh, I wanna shake it up
Baby, baby, ooh, ooh, baby
You ain't gotta front if you want me
