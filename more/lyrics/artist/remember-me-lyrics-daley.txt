Remember me!!
So you confess,
To all the way you've been seeing
Now you feel regret, yeah
But that don't mean shit to me
No, no
So empty what you can say
Take a minute please
It's too little too late
To make it up to me
I hope that those tears refresh your memory
Now when another makes you cry
[Chorus]
That's when you, remember me
I'm the one that had you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby
Remember me
I'm the one that had you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby
I guess it wasn't enough
To give you everything, no no
And I guess I should have know better
How could I be so naive
I don't know,
So empty what you can say
Take a minute please
It's too little too late
To make it up to me
I hope that those tears refresh your memory
Now when you're all alone at night
[Chorus]
That's when you, remember me
I'm the one that had you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby
Remember me
I'm the one that had you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby
Now when you all alone at night
[Chorus]
That's when you, remember me
I'm the one that had you baby
I'm the one who loved you baby
Remember me
I'm the one that had you baby
I'm the one who loved you.
