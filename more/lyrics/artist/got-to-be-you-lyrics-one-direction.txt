[Liam]
Girl I see it in your eyes youre disappointed
Cause Im the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
I tore it apart
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am asking you for one more chance
[Harry]
Can we fall one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh, and if you walk away
I know Ill fade
Cause there is nobody else
It's gotta be you
Only you
It's got to be you
Only you
Hey (hey)
[Liam]
Now, girl, I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me I dont resemble who I was
Youve almost had enough
And your actions speak louder than your words
And youre about to break from all youve heard
But dont be scared, I aint going nowhere
[Zayn]
Ill be here by your side
No more fears, no more crying
But if you walk away
I know Ill fade
'Cause there is nobody else
It's gotta be you
Only you
It's got to be you
Only you
[Zayn]
Oh, girl,
Can we try one more, one more time?
One more, one more?
Can we try one more, one more time?
I'll make it better
One more, one more,
Can we try one more, one more...
[Zayn]
Can we try one more time and make it all better?
[Harry]
'Cause it's gotta be you
It's gotta be you
Only you
Only you
It's gotta be you
Only you
It's got to be you
Only you
