I see them coming, yeah.
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop.
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop.
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop. No.
I, I see them coming, coming.
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop.
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop.
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop. No.
Yeah, i think they mad 'cause I'm driving in the fast lane
but i've been grindin' for years, ask hype game
It's funny how stuff doesn't change
From sleepin' in the car to coppin' me that Range
I'm all world star
All them other blogs
All them haters hatin' cause I am a heart throb
But do i want it all?
All the negativity is not gonna get rid of me
I'm here to make history
I'm speakin' it real
Back track to the days when I ain't have me a deal, yeah
So I'ma show the world that I'm ill
Every beat that i get on best believe I'ma kill
So you can have all the jewelry
Have all the cars
Have all the fame
Have all the broads
you can have the fact that I'm a star
Just so you can listen to these bars

Yeah, they talk. Yeah, they talk.
They don't walk the walk I walk.
I won't stop, 'til I drop.
Until then, I reach the top.
I'ma rock to where I need to be.
Walk the path of destiny.
Definitely been neglected, but God is always testin' me.
Rest in peace to all the men that died that were protecting me. Objectively, I need to tell you what just gets the best of me.
Essentially, people in this world just wanna let it be.
John Lennon meant it different though, just let it be.
Set it free.
Never be scared to make change, effectively.
Always look at things from different ways, perspectively.
Every person in this world can do good.
I just want this message understood.
Alright.. stop.
Everybody's gotta listen make the decision to envision a better place with no division.
Religion.
Everybody needs a mission. Haters need to stop it, just listen.
