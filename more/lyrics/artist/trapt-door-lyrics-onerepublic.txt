You say you're a minute from the deep end
They cut cold the courtesy, it's sink or swim now
Your body's aching for a breath, I'll give it to you
With a trap door to take care of all of them
Come away, come away now
You won't stand from afar, you can't be seen
Come away, come away now
'Cause you're too close for me to call
I've seen the foolish shame the wise
You just kept quiet with his own surprises
And your Trojan horse is big enough to save them all
And you're not a foolish one at all
Yeah, come away, come away now
You won't stand from afar when you hear me saying
Come away, come away now
'Cause you're too close for me to call
Lost to found, do you know
You're the victim of?
Kick-slide your pose, let it go
You don't need them
Only flesh, blood and bones
We're the same, you and I
Far too young to die
Come away, come away now
You won't stand from afar, when you hear me saying
Come away, come away now
'Cause you're too close, come away
