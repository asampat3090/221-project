rock
Taking to the floor with the reach to the sky
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie
Locking down the door with the rhythm and rhyme
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie
Trying to recall what you want me to say
I shake it your way, I shake it your way
Counting on the night for a beautiful day
I shake it your way, I shake it your way
And I say you can't get enough
Now you can't get enough
Given a chance I'm gonna be somebody
If for one dance I'm gonna be somebody
Open the door it's gonna make you love me
Facing the floor I'm gonna be somebody
Now it's your time and you know where you stand
With a gun in your hand, with a gun in your hand
Now I'm no longer an ordinary man
Was this your big plan, your gun in your hand?
And I say you can't get enough
Now you can't get enough
Given a chance I'm gonna be somebody
If for one dance I'm gonna be somebody
Open the door it's gonna make you love me
Facing the floor I'm gonna be somebody
Be somebody, be somebody
