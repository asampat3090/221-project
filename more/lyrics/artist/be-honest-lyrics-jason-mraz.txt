OK go, go hang your heart on any tree
You can make yourself available to anybody,
cause every living person knows you are a prize,
Whichever way you go I'll be easy to find,
I don't ask for much just be honest with me 2x
Think of this song as a promise,
you can do what you want
If you decide you wanna move into a new stage,
deleting me from pages in your mission statement,
My love is unconditional make no mistake,
i don't ask for much just be honest with me 2x
Who we are what love is what it wants to be,
We are free and we are having the best day ever by far,
Being treated to the light like a superstar
I can hold space while you see what your heart has to say about me
There's no dotted line to sign away your freedom
I acknowledge you for what you do to keep strong,
I'll always get behind you, don't get me wrong
I don't ask for much just be honest with me 2x
Who we are when love is what it wants to be
We are free and we are having the best day ever by far,
Being treated to the light like a superstar
If I miscommunicated I apologies,
If the picture that I painted wasn't very nice,
My love is standing by you whatever you decide
I don't ask for much just be honest with me 2x
Who we are when love is what it wants to be,
We are free and we are having the best day ever by far
Yes we are.. Yes we are...
