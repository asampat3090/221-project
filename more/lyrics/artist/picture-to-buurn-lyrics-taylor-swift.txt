State the obvious
I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realized you love yourself
More that you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends
That I'm obsessive and crazy
Thats fine, you won't mind if I say
by the way ...
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around
Saying sorry to me
My daddy's going to show you
How sorry you'll be
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
And so watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned
You're just another picture to burn
And if you're missing me
You better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really, really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
Just another picture to burn
Baby burn
