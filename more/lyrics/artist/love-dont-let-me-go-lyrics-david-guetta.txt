You've got me dancin' and cryin', rollin' and flyin'
Love, don't let me go
You've got me drownin' in a river, cold but in fever
Love, don't let me go, don't let me go
You've got me dancin'
You've got me dancin' and cryin', rollin' and flyin'
Love, don't let me go
You've got me drownin' in a river, cold but in fever
Love, don't let me go
You've got me dancin' and cryin', rollin' and flyin'
Love, don't let me go
You've got me drownin' in a river, cold but in fever
Love, don't let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Don't let me go, love don't let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go
Got me drownin' in a river
I was caught by runnin' fever, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, dancin' and cryin'
Dancin' and cryin', dancin' and cryin', hey
