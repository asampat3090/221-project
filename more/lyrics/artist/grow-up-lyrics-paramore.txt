Paramore
rock
I told 'em all where to stick it
I left town with a dime to my name
Said Im done with all of my fake friends
Self-righteous pawns in a losing game
Got my band and a light that won't go out
Been burning since the day I was born
So I'll cry just a little then I'll dry my eyes
Cause I'm not a little girl no more
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Stood in line for so long just to pick it
Something I will never understand
Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
Wont you just admit you don't care?
Lady I don't want your pity
So don't feel sad for me
I've got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe were both just living out our dream
And some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
We get along for the most part
Me and reality, the light in the dark
And we live alone, in two different worlds
Me in a fantasy, you and your memories
But we get along
We get along
For the most part
We get along
Yeah, for the most part
We get along
For the most part
We get along
We get along
We get along
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (Leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (Leave you behind)
(Leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
(Leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
