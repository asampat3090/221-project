pop
You could throw me
In the fire
And I won't be burned
For my faith
Is Your desire
And Your love endures
You could throw me
In the prison cell
Shackle me up
Against the rail
But time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Chorus:
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My trials
And tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My sin
And temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall
And He
Will pick me up
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail
You could cast me
In the lion's den
But they won't harm me
For Your grace
Surrounds me
And it sets me free
And I can walk
Upon the water
And I will not drown
For my eyes are
Set upon You
And no one
Can bring me down
For His angels
Surround me
And You've poured out
This blood covering
And I will walk
And not fail
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time
And time again
My faith won't fail
