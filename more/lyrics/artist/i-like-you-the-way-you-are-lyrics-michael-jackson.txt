MICHAEL:
Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for

The way you make me feel, babe
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
Hee
My lonely days are gone
Ooh
