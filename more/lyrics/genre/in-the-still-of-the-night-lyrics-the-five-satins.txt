blues
In the still of the night
I held you, held you tight
'Cause I love, love you so
Promise I'll never let you go
In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)
I remember that night in May
The stars were bright above
I'll hope and I'll pray
To keep your precious love
Well before the light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)
So before the light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)
In the still of the night
