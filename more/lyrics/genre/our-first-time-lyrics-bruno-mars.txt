Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby
Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby
Girl, here we are
In this big old empty room
Starin' at each other
Who's gonna make the first move
Been doin' our thing for a minute
And now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way
Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
'Cause I got you all night
Don't you worry about a thing, no, no, no
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time, go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Clothes are not required
For what we got planned
Oh girl, you're my desire
Your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess
Ooh girl, you're so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day
Gonna eat you before you melt away, yeah
Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
'Cause I got you all night
Don't you worry about a thing, no, no, no
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time, go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby
Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time, go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
