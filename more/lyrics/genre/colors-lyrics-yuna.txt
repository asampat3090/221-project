Yuna
indie
I'm lying on the floor
I'm drowning from the storm you make
We both know it's difficult
Nobody said we'll get hurt this way
Don't say that I don't have to stay here any longer
Who are you to tell me what I don't deserve?
(chorus)
You need to listen when I say
I just want you
Hold on don't let it slip away
I just want you
Know that I can't go on another day
Don't let all the colors fade away
Love was something that
I thought I'd figure out on my own
An empty space my armour crumped is all I see went you're gone
You say all the things
That I don't want to hear
But silence is not what I want either
(chorus)
You need to listen when I say
I just want you
Hold on don't let it slip away
I just want you
Know that I can't go on another day
Don't let all the colors fade away
