[Intro]
([Jay-Z]Best rapper alive) x4
[Jay-Z] Whoo!...Ladies and gentlemen...
[Eminem] You're now about to witness the power of...
[Jay-Z] H, to the Izzo... and...
[Eminem] Shady (ha-ha)... It's showtime
[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
Yo, gather round hustlers that's if you still livin
And get on down, to that ol' Jig rhythm
Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison
A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high
I, Young 'Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers I'm back motherfuckers
Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns
Y'all can't fuck with Hov', what type of X y'all on?
I got great lawyers for cops so dress warm
Charges don't stick to dude he's teflon
I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred
I'm not guilty, now GIMME back my bread
Mr. District Attorney I'm not sure if they told you
I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to
plus - Hov' don't run, Hov' stand and fight
Hov's a soldier, Hov' been fightin all his life so
What could you do to me? It's not new to me
Sue me; fuck you - what's a couple dollars to me?
But you will respect me, simple as that
Or I got no problem goin back
I'm representin for the seat where Rosa Parks sat
Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The ruler's back
[Chorus]
(Best Rapper Alive) x4
[Jay-Z]
Uhh, uh-huh uhh uhh
I, am, BACK, niggaz -
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn the motherfuckin music up
[Jay-Z & Eminem] Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
[Eminem]"Give me the mic, show me where the fucking studio's at"
[Verse 2 - Eminem]
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex, a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass
[Chorus]

[Em & Jay-Z] "Can't leave rap alone the game needs me"
