When it's black,
Take a little time to hold yourself,
Take a little time to feel around,
Before it's gone,
You won't let go,
But you still keep on falling down,
Remember how you saved me now,
From all of my wrongs yeah,
If there's love just feel it,
If there's life we'll see it,
This is no time to be alone, alone, yeah,
I, wont let you go,
Say those words,
Say those words like there's nothing else,
Close your eyes and you might believe,
That there is some way out yeah,
Open up,
Open up your heart to me now,
Let it all come pouring out,
Theres nothing I can't take,
If there's love just feel it,
And if there's life we'll see it,
This ain't no time to be alone, alone, yeah
I, wont let you go,
If your sky is falling,
Just take my hand and hold it,
You don't have to be alone, alone, yeah,
I, won't let you go,
And if you feel the fading of the light,
And you're too weak to carry on the fight,
And all your friends that you count on have disappeared,
I'll be here, not gone, forever, holding on, Oh,
If there's love just feel it,
And if there's life we'll see it,
This ain't no time to be alone, alone, yeah,
I, wont let you go,
If your sky is falling,
Just take my hand and hold it,
You don't have to be alone, alone, yeah,
I won't let you go,
I wont let you go, I wont let, x 2,
I won't let you go x 2
