Yuna
indie
Find your light
Don't hide from what you are
And rise before you fall
And hope for something more
Live if you really want to
Live if you really want to
All my life I've been looking for something amazing
It's almost like I've been stargazing
The sky is right above me
We were meant for something bigger than this
Don't ever try to dismiss yourself cause you don't have to
(Chorus)
All my life my dreams just seemed so far away
And now it's like theyre here to stay
I hold it close to me
We were meant for something bigger than this
Don't ever try to dismiss yourself cause you don't have to
(Chorus) x2
Live if we really want to
Live if we really want to
Live if we really want to
Live if we really want to
