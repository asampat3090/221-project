It was a Friday morning, I was really boring
I wish it was night, a struggle and a fight
When I saw her there was a good affair
She's so nice, she's so cool, I don't think shes a fool
When I saw her last time, was a day at school
But at school it isn't fine, yeah the school isnt cool
I was drunken that night, without thinking about
I was really gone 'cause we had much fun
Without thinking about, I went go more far
I was really almost, knocked down by a car
CHORUS 2X:
I would take her, I would find her, she's my target
The way I want her, and her money, that's sounds funny
I hope her friends like me ,or do they hate me
My friends don't like her, but I really don't care
She is more important, than my stupid friends
They can say what they want to, ''just do what you want to!''
When I saw her last time ,was a day at school
But at school it isn't fine, yeah the school isnt cool
I was drunken that night, without thinking about
I was really gone 'cause we had much fun
Without thinking about, I went go more far
I was really almost, knocked down by a car
CHORUS 4X
