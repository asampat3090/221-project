Imagine a world without me - say you're falling apart
Let's pretend you've missed me for a while
Wouldn't you say you were lonely and love was breaking your heart?
Put on your Sunday best and fake a smile
I dream of dreaming dreams of her - in twilight she's a constant blur
The picture is clear and I'm still fact she's fiction
Remember the night you were with me - fell asleep by my side
Strangers together - your hand in mine
How come we never came closer when all the stars were aligned?
I thought we had a moment
I dream of dreaming dreams of her - in twilight she's a constant blur
The picture is clear and I'm still fact she's fiction
I seem to miss the missing part, she's still my favorite work of art
The picture is clear and I'm still fact she's fiction
Nothing has changed cause I'm still fact - she's fiction
Or I may be imperfectly formed in this contradiction
I dream of dreaming dreams of her - in twilight she's a constant blur
The picture is clear cause I'm still fact she's fiction
I fell in love with her longing - let's just say that she never found out
Who it was she never found in me
