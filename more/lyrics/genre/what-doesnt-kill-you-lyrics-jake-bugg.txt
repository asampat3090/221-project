Step out the door 2 a.m yesterday
Me and my friend keeping the night aflame
And as we're walking in the clear limelight
Two guys come up and take him out of sight
All I know is once they they hit him hard he doubles up they take his money and they run and all I can do is watch them go
His hands are round his nose
His blood is on his clothes
What doesn't kill ya
What doesn't hurt
Sometimes you feel you're up against the world
What doesn't kill ya
What doesn't break
This life it seems
To bring you to your knees
You try you bleed then finally you breathe
She was the dream that kept me up at night
I couldn't face the world without her eyes
I never knew it till she disappeared
My life would be a bunch of souvenirs
All I know is what it is her heart she doubles up she packs her bag and then she runs and all I can do is watch her go
I've lost all I own
What doesn't kill ya
What doesn't hurt
Sometimes you feel you're up against the world
What doesn't kill ya
What doesn't break
This life it seems
To bring you to your knees
You try you bleed then finally you breathe
What doesn't kill ya
What doesn't hurt
Sometimes you feel you're up against the world
What doesn't kill ya
What doesn't break
This life it seems
To bring you to your knees
You try you bleed then finally you breathe
