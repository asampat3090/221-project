Apocalyptica
metal
I try to make it through my life,
In my way, there's you
I try to make it through these lies
And That's all, I do
Just don't deny it
Don't try to fight this
And deal with it
That's just part of it.
If you were dead or still alive,
I don't care,
I don't care
Just go and leave this all behind
Cause I swear (I swear)
I don't care
I try to make you see my side
I Always try to stay in line
But your eyes see right through
That's all they do
I'm getting buried in this place
I've got no room you're in my face
Don't say anything just go away
If you were dead or still alive,
I don't care,
I don't care
Just go and leave this all behind,
Cause I swear
I swear
I don't care,
(Love changing everything)
(You won't be there for me)
(Love changing everything)
(You won't be there for me)
[Piano solo]
If you were dead or still alive,
I don't care,
I don't care
Just go and leave this all behind,
Cause I swear
I swear
I don't care
If you were dead or still alive,
I don't care,
I don't care
Just go and leave this all behind,
I don't care
I swear
I don't care
At all
