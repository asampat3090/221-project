Lucifer son of da mornin'
I'm gonna chase you out of earth
Lucifer, Lucifer son of da mornin'
I'm from the murder capitol
Where we murder for capitol
Lucifer, Lucifer son of da mornin'
I'm gonna chase you out of earth
Lucifer, Lucifer son of da mornin'
So you niggas change your attitude
For they askin' what happened to you
Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a rightous 'cause for sinnin'
Them a murder me so I gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performin procedures
Jesus, I ain't tryin' to be facetious
But "Vengance is mine" said the Lord
You said it better than all, leave niggas on deaths door
Breathin off respirators for killin' my best boy, haters
On permenant hiatus as I escape
In the Maybach Benz
Fly this then sanaa lathan
Pumpin' Brown Sugar by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles, like an evangelist
How can you introduce you to your maker ?
Bring you closer to nature
Ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been readin your psalms and chapters
Payin' your tithes being good Catholics, I'm comin'
Lucifer, Lucifer son of da mornin'
I'm gonna chase you out of earth
Lucifer, Lucifer son of da mornin'
I'm from the murder capitol
Where we murder for capitol
Lucifer, Lucifer son of da mornin'
I'm gonna chase you out of earth
Lucifer, Lucifer son of da mornin'
So you niggas change your attitude
For they askin' what happened to you, yes
This is Holy war I wet cha all with the Holy water
Spray from the Heckler Koch auto
Matic all the static shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical I throw a couple at you
Take six, spread love to all of my dead thugs
I'll pour out a little Louie to a head above
Yes sir, and when I perish the meek shall inherit the earth
Until that time it's on a poppin' Church
Like Don Bishop the fifth upon cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the Holy Ghost please
I leave ya in somebodys Cathedral
And stuntin' like Evil Knievel
I'll let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk the more you irkin' us
The more you gonna need memorial services
The Black Album's second verse is like
Devil's Pie save some dessert for us
Man I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy till somebody dies
Man I gotta get my soul right
'For I'm locked up for my whole life
Evertime it seems it's all right
Somebody want they soul to rise
I'll chase you off of this earth
I got dreams of holdin' a Nine milla to Bobs killa
Askin' him why? as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten holmes I still feel ya
So curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who 'caused your Church mass, reverse the crash
Reverse the blast, and reverse the car
Reverse the day, and there you are
Bob Allah, Lord forgive him we all have sinned
But Bobs a good dude please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the sun of the mournin'
Thanks again
