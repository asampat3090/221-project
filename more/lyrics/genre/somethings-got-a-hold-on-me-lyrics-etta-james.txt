Sometimes I get a good feeling
I get a feeling that I never, never, never
Never had before no, no
And I just wanna tell you right now
That I, I believe, I really do believe that
Something's got a hold on me
(Oh, it must be love)
Something's got a hold on me right now child
(Oh, it must be love)
Let me tell you now
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk
I said, Oh
(Oh)
Oh
(Oh)
Oh
(Oh)
Oh
(Oh)
Yeah, oh, it must be love
(You know it must be love)
Let me tell you now
Something's got a hold on me, yeah
(Oh, it must be love)
Something's got a hold on me right now child
(Oh, it must be love)
Let me tell you now
I've never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I believe I'd die if I only could
I feel so strange, but I sure feel good
I said, Oh
(Oh)
Oh
(Oh)
Oh
(Oh)
Oh
(Oh)
Yeah, oh, It must be love
(You know it must be love)
Let me tell you now
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I never thought it could happen to me
Got me heavy when I'm in misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me
I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)
Oh, you know it walks like love
(You know it walks like love)
He talk like love
(You know he talks like love)
Make me feel alright
(Make me feel alright)
In the middle of the night
(In the middle of the night)
La, la, la
(La, la, la)
La, la, la
(La, la, la)
