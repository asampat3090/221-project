All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there, and they say "yeah," and they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in, put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there
(Ludacris)
Luda, Ludacris goin' in on the verse
'Cause I never been defeated, and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up, put 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went nowhere
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Ludayac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flows
My hands go up and down like strippers' booties go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out, y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the South's champion
'Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I
All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there, and they say "yeah," and they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in, put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there
Swerving in my lolo, head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone, passengers, when they see it, they say "oh boy!"
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me Loco
That's for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that 4-4
Ask you what you laughing at, represent that mud life
Dirty money, bitch, you better get your mud right
We come together holding hands and holla "thug life"
We are strapped in all black, it's like thug life
(All we do is win)
You riding the what? 'Cause we riding tonight
You riding with me 'cause you wasn't riding right
All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there, and they say "yeah," and they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in, put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there
Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust 'til I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, boss 'em up
Pardon me, I bossing the pressure up, bless ya bro
Don't mess with us, we like The U in the 80's
Back to back set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
Bitch, I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, "just win baby win"
All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there, and they say "yeah," and they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in, put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there
