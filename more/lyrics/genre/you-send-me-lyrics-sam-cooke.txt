Darling, you send me
I know you send me
Darling, you send me
Honest, you do, honest, you do
Honest, you do
Ohh, you thrill me
I know you, you, you thrill me
Darling, you, you, you thrill me
Honest, you do
At first I thought it was infatuation
But, oh, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home
Ohh, you, you, you send me
I know you send me
I know you send me
Honest, you do
Ohh, whenever I'm with you
I know, I know, I know and I need you
Honest, you do
Honest, you do
Ohh, I know, I know, I know when you hold me
Whenever you kiss me
Honest, you do
At first I thought it was infatuation
But, ooh, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home
I know, I know, I know you send me
I know you send me
Ohh, you, you, you, you send me
Honest, you do
