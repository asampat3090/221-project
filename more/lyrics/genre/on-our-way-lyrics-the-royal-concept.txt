rock
I'll believe when the walls stop turning
I'll believe when the storm is through
I believe I hear them say
David won't you stop writing songs
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
Oh no, let's go
We are young
We are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place place place
We're on our way way way
We're on our way way way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close close close
We're losing time time time
We're losing time time time
We're falling to the ground
I'll believe when the sky is burning
I'll believe when I see the view
I believe that I hear them say
David won't you stop dreaming now
And everybody clap your hands and shout
And everybody clap your hands and shout
Oh no, they shout
We are young
We are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place place place
We're on our way way way
We're on our way way way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close close close
We're losing time time time
We're losing time time time
We're falling to the ground
We are young
We are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place place place
We're on our way way way
We're on our way way way
We're on our way
Hold me close
We're losing time
Hold me close
We're falling to the ground
Taxi driver, sun is rising
Damn the sirens, keep on driving
Flashing light, oh what a night
I miss her bed, I lost my head
And it's sunning, we're still running
For her rooftop, our last stop
Barefoot, naked, don't you let me go
To your place place place
We're on our way way way
We're on our way way way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close close close
We're losing time time time
We're losing time time time
We're falling to the ground
We are young
We are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place place place
We're on our way way way
We're on our way way way
We're on our way
This night will never end
This night will never end
This night will never end
This night will never end
Hold me close, we're losing time
Hold me close, we're falling to the ground
