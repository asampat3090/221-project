pop
Oh yea
Come on
You get the limo out front
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you but no one ever discovers
In some ways you're just like all your friends
But on stage you're a star
You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that
It's the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds
You go the movie premiers
(Is that Orlando Bloom?)
Hear your songs on the radio
Livin' two lives is a little weird
But school's cool cuz nobody knows
Yea you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar
You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that
It's the best of both
You know the best of both worlds
Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines
The best part's that
You get to be who ever you wanna be
Yea best of both
You get the best of both
Come on, best of both
Who would of thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar?
You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that
It's the best
You get the best of both worlds
Without the shades and the hair
You can go anywhere
You get the best of both girls
Mix it all together
Oh yea
It's so much better cuz you know
You've got the best of both worlds
