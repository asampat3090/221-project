Oh, you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
but then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm crying crying
Uh, seemed like everything was going fine
I found love that I thought was gonna last
Then I accidentally saw few things in your cell
I even lol'ed, man I should've known
Why, why you're doing what you do
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See I'm not really down with this
This ain't no textin' shit
No I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name
I got two letters for you
One of them is F
And the other one is U
'Cause what you gotta do
Is go get yourself a clue
Only two letters to choose
One of them is F
And the other one's U
SMH I'm pressing send on you
Coulda been this
Coulda been that
We done been there
We done been back
Coulda said this
Coulda said that
Why you trippin'?
Let me hear that
I ain't tryna argue no more
I do it all for you
You know you're my rider
Baby let me show you
I know what's been going on
Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think, I'd stick around
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Z
I got a lot of nasty things
Blowing up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't, I don't give a flying
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name
I got two letters for you
One of them is F
And the other one is U
'Cause what you gotta do
Is go get yourself a clue
Only two letters to choose
One of them is F
And the other one's U
SMH I'm pressing send on you
Two letters for you
What you trippin' on
Girl you know you're wrong
Don't let these girls drive you crazy
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name
I got two letters for you
One of them is F
And the other one is U
'Cause what you gotta do
Is go get yourself a clue
Only two letters to choose
One of them is F
And the other one's U
SMH I'm pressing send on you
