Hey you can tell the world
You're leaving.
And you can pack your bags
And spread your wings.
And you can tell them all
That it's over
But while you wave goodbye
I'll be getting closer.
Stand there and look into my eyes
And tell me that all we had were lies.
Show me that you don't care
And I'll stay here
If you prefer
Yes, I'll leave you
Without a word.
Without a word.
And you can tell the world
That you're tired.
But your excuses, they won't work
Cause I know that you're lying.
Every time that I see your face
I notice all the suffering.
Just turn to my embrace
I won't let come to nothing.
Stand there and look into my eyes
And tell me that all we had were lies.
Show me that you don't care
And I'll stay here
If you prefer
Yes, I'll leave you
Without a word.
Without a word.
Without a word.
Without a word.
Without a word.
Without a word.
