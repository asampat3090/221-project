[Chris Brown]
You've got that smile,
That only heaven can make.
I pray to God everyday,
That you keep that smile.
[Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you are my dream,
There's not a thing I won't do.
I'll give my life up for you,
Cause you are my dream.
[Bridge]
And baby, everything that I have is yours,
You will never go cold or hungry.
I'll be there when you're insecure,
Let you know that you're always lovely.
Girl, cause you are the only thing that I got right now
[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling,
I'll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
I'll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
[Chris Brown]
If You had my child,
(My lady)
You would make my life complete
(My lady)
Just to have your eyes on little me,
That'd be mine forever.
[Bridge]
And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely
Girl, cause you are the only thing that I got right now
[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling,
I'll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
I'll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
[Bridge]
We're made for one another
Me and you
And I have no fear
I know we'll make it through
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Ohh ohh ohh ohhhhh
[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling,when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you,right next to you
Right next to you.right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
I'll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Oh nah nah
Oh yeah
Stand by my side,side,side
When the sky falls down
Oh baby
I'll be there,i'll be there
You've got that smile,
That only heaven can make.
I pray to God everyday,
To keep you forever.
