Nightwish
metal
An old man by a seashore at the end of day
Gazes the horizon with sea winds in his face
Tempest tossed island, seasons all the same
Anchorage unpainted and a ship without a name
Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard
He lightens the beacon light at the end of world
Showing the way, lighting hope in their hearts
The ones on their travels homeward from afar
This is for long forgotten light at the end of the world
Horizon crying the tears he left behind long ago
The albatross is flying, making him daydream
The time before he became one of the world's unseen
Princess in the tower, children in the fields
Life gave him it all an island of the universe
Oh, now his love's a memory, a ghost in the fog
He sets the sails one last time saying farewell to the world
Anchor to the water, seabed far below
Grass still in his feet and a smile beneath his brow
This is for long forgotten light at the end of the world
Horizon crying the tears we left behind long ago
So long ago, so long ago
This is for long forgotten light at the end of the world
Horizon crying the tears we left behind so long ago
So long ago
