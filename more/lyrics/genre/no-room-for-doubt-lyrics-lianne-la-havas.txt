You caught me, guilty
Taking the pieces of you
That night, you took flight
I couldn't decide what to do
I won't let a safe bet
Continue to make me go blue
I could go solo
Would that be the right thing to do?
We all make mistakes, we do
I learnt from you
We all make mistakes, we do
I learnt from you
I tiptoe, too slow
Out of the door to your house
I know you know
That this way leads me out
Outside, too bright
You're within I'm without
You're within
We all make mistakes, we do
I learnt from you
We all make mistakes, we do
I learnt from you
Please sleep softly
Leave me no room for doubt
Please sleep softly
Leave me no room for doubt
Please sleep softly
Leave me no room for doubt
Please sleep softly
Leave me no room for doubt
Leave me no room for doubt
We all make mistakes, we do
I learnt from you
We all make mistakes, we do
I learnt from you
We all make mistakes, we do
I learnt from you
We all make mistakes, we do
I learnt from you
Oh
Please sleep softly
Leave me no
Please sleep softly
Leave me no room for doubt
Please sleep softly
Leave me no
Please sleep softly
Leave me no room for doubt
