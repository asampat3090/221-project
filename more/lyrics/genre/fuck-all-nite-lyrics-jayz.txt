Use to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? -- You should be comin home with me
Sittin in this lap with the luxury
Now you can, come in the mornin while wakin up (Yeah!)
Actin like you behave and stuff (Uh-huh!)
You should be comin home with me
Sittin in this lap with the luxury, now check it
Yes a lime to a lemon, my V-A women
Walk in Manolo Blahniks cause my condo with elevators in 'em
She wanna wrinkle my linens
So I sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinnin, uhh
Blasphemy, oh my God, we be sinnin
She keeps scratchin me like she tiger in 'em
This is exactly, why I had to pin her
To the bed like a wrestler, her to press on her, uhh
Her man kept pagin, stressin her
So I told her what to say just in case he question her
"Situations will arise, but you gotta be smart about it"
No matter what you do, don't talk about us
Don't give him no info, he'll be lost without it
Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again
Bring a friend
Use to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)

Guess who's back in my mothaf**kin house
Half black, half white chick, I call her Minnie Mouse
We always hook up when we out
We do what we like to do and then we out
But lately I've been havin the strangest feelings
Your boy Young Hov' catchin feelings
And it's messin up my dealings cause mami's not willin
To leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend
Said, "We was just 'sposed to hook up and have a glass"
She called me her emergency d**k-in-the-glass
Hehehe I had to laugh for a second
Had to check myself, get my mackin back in perspective
I slack for a second but I'm back, no question
Like I walk with a cane, ain't no half-steppin
Jeah, and on that note
Iceberg Slim is back to rock her boat, c'mon
Use to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
