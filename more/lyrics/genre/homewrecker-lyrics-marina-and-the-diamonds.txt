Every boyfriend is the one, until otherwise proven
The good are never easy, the easy never good
And love, it never happens like you think it really should
Deception and perfection are wonderful traits
One will breed love, the other hate
You'll find me in the lonely hearts
Under "I'm after a brand new start"
And I dont belong to anyone
They call me:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
They call me:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
Girls and their curls and their gourmet vomit
Boys and their toys and their 6 inch rockets
We're all very lovely 'til we get to know each other
As we stop becoming friends and we start becoming lovers
And I dont belong to anyone
They call me:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
I'm only happy when I'm on the run
They call me:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
I broke a million hearts just for fun
They call me:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
I'm only happy when I'm on the run
They call me:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
I broke a million hearts just for fun
I'm only happy when I'm on the run
I break a million hearts just for fun
I don't belong to anyone
I guess you could say that my life's a mess
But I'm still looking pretty in this dress
I'm the image of deception
When everything is life and death
You may feel like there's nothing left
Instead of love and trust and laughter
What you get is happy never after
But deep down, all you want is love
The pure kind we all dream of
But we cannot escape the past
So you and I will never last...
Cause I'm a:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
I'm only happy when I'm on the run
Cause I'm a:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
I broke a million hearts just for fun
Cause I'm a:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
I'm only happy when I'm on the run
Cause I'm a:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
I broke a million hearts just for fun
Cause I'm a:
Homewrecker, homewrecker
