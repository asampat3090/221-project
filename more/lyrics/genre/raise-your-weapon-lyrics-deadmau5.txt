Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy
Launch your assault now, take it easy
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
One word and it's over
Rippin' through like a missile
Rippin' through my heart
Rob me of this love
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon and it's over
Love your ego, you won't feel a thing
Always number one
The pen with a bent wrist crooked king
Sign away our peace for your war, one word and it's over
Dropping your bombs now
On all we've built
How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
Raise your weapons, raise your weapons and it's over
Rippin' through like a missile
Rippin' through my heart, rob me of this love
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon and it's over
How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy
Launch your assault now, take it easy
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
One word and it's over
Rippin' through like a missile
Rippin' through my heart
Rob me of this love
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon and it's over
Love your ego, you won't feel a thing
Always number one
The pen with a bent wrist crooked king
Sign away our peace for your war, one word and it's over
Dropping your bombs now
On all we've built
How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
Raise your weapons, raise your weapons and it's over
