Bastille
alternative
When you fall asleep
With your head upon my shoulder
When you're in my arms
But you've gone somewhere deeper
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace?
Only to wake and hide your face
When oblivion is calling out your name
You always take it further than I ever can
When you play it hard
And I try to follow you there
It's not about control
But I turn back when I see where you go
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?
But oblivion is calling out your name
You always take it further than I ever can
When oblivion is calling out your name
You always take it further than I ever can
