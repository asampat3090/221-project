All you overloaded, candy coated?
Your life's imploding now
There's a risk worth taking, a pain worth aching
On this hollow ground
We can let go
Don't hold on to all of life's hardest parts
When we think of stopping, let's keep on rocking
To the rhythm of our hearts
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race, become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah, good and broken
Find the magic, go and grab it
Your fate is in your hands
Come on, find a reason to believe
And just tell yourself, "We can!"
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race, become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah, good and broken
Get off your seat, on your feet
Raise your hands, feel the beat
Let it go, lose control
Feel it in your soul
Don't you know what you can do
If you have faith in you
Let's not be invisible
There's no red light in life, just go!
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race, become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah, good and broken
We can, we can, yeah!
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can
Oh we can
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can
Oh we can
Good and broken
