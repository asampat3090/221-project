It's how we do what we do, man
When we do what we do, what, what
Project shit what
I know you see me looking, girl go on and act right
A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight
Now turn around and let me see just what ya curved like
Go grab your friends and y'all can come to the back
Why don't you take a sip upon this champagne
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hour-glass shape you got upon that frame
I like the way you talk your game we might be one and the same
Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all of y'all
Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call
I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya
And when I call don't give me the run-around
I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl, there ain't nothin' to think about
'Cause you got me feigning, but girl you don't hear me
Little lady, you got me just
Screwed up off of your melody
Little lady, c'mon and don't
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me
Little lady, you got me just
Screwed up off of your melody
Easy baby c'mon and don't
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me
You're kinda cute, baby, are you new in town?
My name is Tim, AKA Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost, do you know your way around
If you got a problem baby I can hold ya down
I can be your navigator or your compass
Better yet a genie baby make your first wish
You the party, baby, I'm just the guest list
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless
So grab your friends, let's take it back to my house
Let's watch 'Sex and the City' or 'Desperate Housewives'
Simon says touch yours while you touch mine
Parental discretion is advised
Y'all can be the star in my spotlight
Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit, a little bit of act right
Y'all looking shy, but ya act like y'all don't hear me
Little lady, you got me just
Screwed up off of your melody
Little lady, c'mon and don't
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me
Little lady, you got me just
Screwed up off of your melody
Easy baby c'mon and don't
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me
See girl you stronger than the strongest drug I ever had
You could mix 'em all together you still be twice as bad
'Cause you the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to kick than cigarettes and green thangs
Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute gurl an' pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, "How you do me this way?"
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah
They call me Juicy J straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab playa on these streets I'm tryin' a holla at ya
Quit playing games girl you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town
I just want to pick you up and take you to a bachelor nest
Is it good? Is it good? And have a little smack fest
So if you never call me I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessey
Little lady, you got me just
Screwed up off of your melody
Little lady, c'mon and don't
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me
Little lady, you got me just
Screwed up off of your melody
Easy baby c'mon and don't
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me
Screwed up
Chop me up
Screwed up off of your melody
Chop me up, please don't make a fool of me
