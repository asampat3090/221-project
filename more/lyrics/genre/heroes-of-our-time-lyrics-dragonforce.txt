Dragonforce
metal
Lost in a dream, finally it seems
Emptiness and everlasting madness
See the sadness grow, watching as we know
Blinded for our journey for the world
Call for us, the power in all of us
So far beyond the blackened sky tonight
Glorious, forevermore in us
We are victorious and so alive
We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow
And journey on towards a brighter day
Silent tears we left behind still so far away
Across the endless sands through the fields of our despair
Here for all eternity we stand, yeah
Rise above the universe tonight
Starchaser
Fly towards the storm, see the world reborn
Feel the pain inside the voice of sorrow
Cross the distant shores, find the open door
Stand alone in judgment for tomorrow
Years of pain still haunt us all, we saw the last sunrise
Take me home in freedom for a lifetime
Praying out for the silence and the last tears we'll cry
Still glorious this fire inside, united we stand
And we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow
And journey on towards a brighter day
Silent tears we left behind still so far away
Across the endless sands through the fields of our despair
Here for all eternity we stand, yeah
Rise above the universe tonight
Starchaser
Free from this world, here for the last time
Oceans collide inside of us all
Believe who we are, the phoenix will guide us
Freedom will rise once again
Save us tonight, the last hope for all of us
Light years gone by, we're still holding on
Save us tonight, a star shines in all of us
Far beyond our lives, still our glory lives on
And we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow
And journey on towards a brighter day
Silent tears we left behind still so far away
Across the endless sands to the fields of our despair
Here for all eternity we stand, yeah
Rise above the universe tonight
Starchaser, starchaser
Our kingdom come, we stand as one
And we will live for always evermore
