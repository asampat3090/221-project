Lights, camera, axiom
You say you a bad guy
You-you-you a bad guy
That's why everyone likes you
They say that you're so fun
And you're so cool
They call you Baby Blue
Because it's your favorite color, boy
I'm not worthy of the little girl you nuzzle to
A-A-A-A-A-And they call you Baby Blue
Because it's your favorite color
A-A-A-A-A-And they call you Baby Boy
Because they like you, oh
It's not a joke how much I like you
I know I play it off, but I lie to you
You say hi, say hi, boo
Everyone knows why I do what I do
The city is dangerous
I need your kiss to survive
The city is my dirtiest
I would advise
It's nice, ice, baby
How much I'm liking you
Stone cold, baby
Somebody come and save me
Rock, rock, baby
Somebody come and save me
Rock, rock, baby
You don't want to come and save me
Baby Blue
Because it's your favorite color
Baby Blue
You're always so high
You're such a tough guy
But nothing to boy I knew
How come you got so bad
Remember what we had
Remember how, Baby Blue
A-A-A-A-A-And they call you Baby Blue
Because it's your favorite color
A-A-A-A-A-And they call you Baby Boy
Because they like you, oh
The city is dangerous
I need your kiss to survive
The city is my dirtiest
I would advise
It's nice, ice, baby
How much I'm liking you
Stone cold, baby
Somebody come and save me
Rock, rock, baby
Somebody come and save me
Rock, rock, baby
You don't want to come and save me
Baby Blue
