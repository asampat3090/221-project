Well, it's good to hear your voice
I hope you're doing fine
And if you ever wondered
I'm lonely here tonight
I'm lost here in this moment
And time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish
I'd have you by my side
Oh, oh, I miss you
Oh, oh, I need you
And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay, I will stay
Well, I tried to live without you
The tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside
I look up at the stars
Hoping you're doing the same
And somehow I feel closer
And I can hear you say
Oh, oh, I miss you
Oh, oh, I need you
I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay, I will stay, always stay
I never wanna lose you
And if I had to, I would choose you
So always stay, please, always stay
You're the one that I hold on to
'Cause my heart would stop without you
I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay, I will stay, I'll always stay
And I love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask, I will stay, I will stay, I will stay
