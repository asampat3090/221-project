Pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look at here the crowd is jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party going on the dance floor
See 'cos that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you're too bad
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
Make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day
Make my day, make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
Make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day
Make my day, make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day
Pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look at here the crowd is jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party going on the dance floor
See 'cos that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you're too bad
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
Make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day
Make my day, make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day
Pump up the jam, pump it up
A pump it up, yo pump it
Pump up the jam, pump it
A pump it up, yo pump it
Pump up the jam, pump it
A pump it up, yo pump it
Pump up the jam
Pump it, pump it, pump it
