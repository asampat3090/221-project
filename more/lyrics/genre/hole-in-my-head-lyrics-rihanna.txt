(Rihanna)
No use, your lips keep movin' but I got a Couple screws Loose,
Them other boys Talkin' about me; they say I'm bad news,
And probably best for you to Keep this Short
Its my Turn to Interrupt, Doesn't take alot to Start me up
I don't Think you really wanna do it right now
Not with me (with me), Don't start with me (with me)
(I got ) I got a gun on me,
I don't think you Really wanna Run your Mouth,
Cause how i Feelin', Water Down
Your Gonna Drown
All over Your Radio, see me in Your Stadium
Ask anybody, Ima Rep this for the ladies Though,
Watch Your Tone around me,
Don't push my Buttons,
You don't really wanna see me get Wild
get-get-get wild
(Rihanna)
I got a hole in my head,
A hole in my head,
Sometimes i get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody,
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hearin' what i said,
I gotta hole in my head,
my head my head I gotta hole in my head,
uh my head my head I gotta hole in my head,
uh my head my head, Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't hearin' what i said,

Buckle up, I ride Just like a Fast Car
Suck it up, Don't Even try to Act Hard
And You can Try to Run but you won't get very far,
And You can Try to Hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see Right Through you

And I knew it the Very Moment i met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Doesn't take a lot to work me up
