Don't call me, leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
'Cuz I don't, no I won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
'Cuz I don't, and I won't need you
Send out a 911
We're gonna have some fun
Hey boy, you know you better run
'Cuz it's a girls' night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out without you
You better hold tight
'Cuz girls' night's without you
Let's go GNO, let's go GNO
Let's go GNO, let's go
It's a girls' night
I'll dance with somebody new
Don't have to think about you
And who knows what let go will lead to
You'll hear from everyone
You'll get the 411
Hey boy, you knew this day would come
'Cuz it's a girls' night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out without you
Let's go GNO, let's go GNO
Let's go GNO, let's go
Hey boy, don't you wish you
Could've been a good boy
Try to find another girl like me boy
Feel me when I tell ya I am fine
And it's time for me to draw the line, I said
Hey boy, don't you wish you
Could've been a good boy
Try to find another girl like me boy
Feel me when I tell ya I am fine
And it's time for me to draw the line
'Cuz it's a girls' night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out without you
You better hold tight
'Cuz girls' night's without you
Let's go GNO, let's go GNO
Let's go GNO, let's go
It's a girls' night
