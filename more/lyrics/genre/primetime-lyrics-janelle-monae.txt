[Verse 1: Janelle Monae]
Tick-tock, I'm watching the clock
I can't wait til we get to rock
I wanna scream and dream and throw a love parade
Is that okay?
Tonight is me and you alone
Won't make a call, won't even write a song
See I've been waiting and waiting for the time to say
Now listen babe
[Pre-Chorus]
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby our love will always keep it real and true
[Chorus]
Cause baby it's a prime time for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a prime time for our love
And heaven is betting on us
[Verse 2: Miguel]
Bang bang, I'm calling your name
You're like a fire the world can't tame
I wanna riot til the stars come out and play
Is that okay? Okay
Tonight is me and you alone
Won't take a call, won't even write a song
This'll be a personal kind of day
Listen baby
[Pre-Chorus 2: Miguel]
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby my love is always right here for you
Yeah
[Chorus x2: Both]
Cause baby it's a prime time for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a prime time for our love
And heaven is betting on us
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus until Fade: Both]
Cause baby it's a prime time for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a prime time for our love
And heaven is betting on us
