pop
C'mon.
Baby we could go,
Back to the basics.
Trailer park love,
Wearing them ASICS,
And gold.
I can speak Spanish,
You can sing for the neighbours,
You've been pretty stupid,
Ever since you got famous.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, wrong side,
Of the tracks, boy.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, if only,
We'd go back, boy.
'Cause nobody does it like you,
I like the way that you move,
That's why I never go through,
With leaving you.
Everybody's sayin' that,
You're not good for me.
Your friends all swear,
That you've changed but,
I still keep it O.G.
This tune could be a reminder,
Of how it all used to be.
So shut up, and come on,
Sing our song.
And let's go back to the basics.
Let's go back to the basics, baby.
Back to the basics,
When you're not wasted,
I know you'll see.
Baby we could go,
Back to the basics, (c'mon),
We were best friends,
Crazy and shameless in love.
You can mow the lawn for money,
I can make you playlists.
You bought me dime packs,
Felt like we were famous.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, best I,
Ever had boy.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, can you,
Remember that, boy?
Nobody knew what we knew,
We had it figured out too,
Us against the world just,
Me and you (ooh-ooh)!
Everybody's sayin' that,
You're not good for me.
Your friends all swear,
That you've changed but,
I still keep it O.G.
This tune could be a reminder,
Of how it all used to be.
So shut up, and come on,
Sing our song.
And let's go back to the basics.
Let's go back to the basics, baby.
Back to the basics,
When you're not wasted,
I know you'll see.
We could drive forever, my baby,
We could leave it all and never look back.
If you wanted heaven, baby,
Sit back in my pink cadillac.
Everybody's sayin' that,
You're not good for me.
Your friends all swear,
That you've changed but,
I still keep it O.G.
This tune could be a reminder,
Of how it all used to be.
So shut up, and come on,
Sing our song.
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.
Everybody's sayin' that,
You're not good for me.
Your friends all swear,
That you've changed but,
I still keep it O.G.
This tune could be a reminder,
Of how it all used to be.
So shut up, and come on,
Sing our song.
And let's go back to the basics.
Let's go back to the basics, baby.
Back to the basics,
When you're not wasted,
I know you'll see.
