Within%20Temptation
metal
When leaves have fallen and skies turned to gray
The night keeps on closing in on the day
A nightingale sings his song of farewell
You better hide for her freezing hell
On cold wings she's coming you better keep moving
For warmth you'll be longing, nightingale
Come on just feel it don't you see it?
You better believe it
When she embraces your heart turns to stone
She comes at night when you're all alone
And when she whispers your blood shall run cold
You better hide before she finds you
Whenever she is raging she takes all life away
Haven't you seen? Haven't you seen?
The ruins of our world
Whenever she is raging she takes all life away
Haven't you seen? Haven't you seen?
The ruins of our world
She covers the earth with a breath taking cloak
The sun awakes and melts it away
The world now opens it's eyes and sees
The dawning of a new day
On cold wings she's coming you better keep moving
For warmth you'll be longing, nightingale
Come on just feel it don't you see it?
You better believe it
Whenever she is raging she takes life away
Haven't you seen? Haven't you seen?
The ruins of our world
Whenever she is raging she takes life away
Haven't you seen? Haven't you seen?
The ruins of our world
