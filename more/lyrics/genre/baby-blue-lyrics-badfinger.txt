Badfinger
rock
Guess I got what I deserve
Kept you waiting there, too long my love
All that time, without a word
Didn't know you'd think, that I'd forget, or I'd regret
The special love I have for you
My baby blue
All the days became so long
Did you really think I'd do you wrong
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize, I would know, I would show
The special love I have for you
My baby blue
What can I do, what can I say?
Except that I want you by my side
How can I show you? Show me a way
Don't you know, the times I tried
Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feeling just grows stronger everyday
Just one thing, before I go
Take good care, baby let me know, let it grow
The special love you have for me
My Dixie dear
