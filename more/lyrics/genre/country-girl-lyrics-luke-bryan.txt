Hey girl, go on now
You know you've got everybody looking
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl, I can't wait
To watch you do your thing
Shake it for the young bucks sitting in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rocking 'til the break of dawn
The DJ spinning that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters, and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl
Aw, country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
That got it in her blood to get a little wild
Ponytail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shake it for the young bucks sitting in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rocking 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinning that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Guitar
Now dance, like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines
Yeah, move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holding you
And get to knowing you, and get to showing you
And get to loving you 'fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do
Shake it for the young bucks sitting in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rocking 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinning that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl
Aw, country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
