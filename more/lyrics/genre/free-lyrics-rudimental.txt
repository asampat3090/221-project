I don't do yoga, never tried Pilates
Not many people want me at their parties
Tryna find my place, some place, oh I, oh I, oh I
I drink a little more than recommended
This world ain't exactly what my heart expected
Tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I
[Chorus:]
See, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But, hey, at least I am free, I am free
If you ask the church then I am no believer
Spend Sundays asleep I'm just another dreamer
Still tryna find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
I guess I ain't too good for money neither
I got two left feet, no, I'm no Jackson either
Just tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I
[Chorus:]
See, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Just tryna find my home sweet home, sweet home, sweet home, sweet home,
I drink a little more than recommended
This ain't exactly what my heart expected
[Chorus:]
Whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free.
Whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
Whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
Whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free.
