You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
Hey, walk out that house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go!
People to see, time is precious
I looked at my cotty, are ya out of control?
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on whoa
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies, it's on
Then pop in the next 'cause this mix'll be ours
We keep a fade-away shot
'Cause we ballin' it's Platinum Patron that be ours
Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the drink with all that goodie powers
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down
Hey, shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like her number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans
My Benjamin Franklins
A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We buildin' castles that's made out of sand
She's amazin', fire blazin'
Hotter than Cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin' at me
Like, "Damn it, I told ya"
You wanna shoot like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your chauffeur
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down
Yeah, I'm spendin' my money, I'm out of control
Somebody help me she takin' my bank roll
But I'm king of the club and I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
