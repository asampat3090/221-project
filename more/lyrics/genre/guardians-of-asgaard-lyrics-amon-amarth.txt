Standing firm against all odds
Guarding the most sacred home
We protect the realm of Gods
Our destiny is carved in stone
Three evil giants of the south
Are constantly on the attack
With lies and fire from their mouths
But we always send them back
We are brothers of the north
Who are sharing the all father's blood
Marching down the left hand path
We are spawned by Asagods
'Cause we are
We're the Guardians
Guardians of Asgaard

Guardians of Asgaard
Guardians of Asgaard
We have faced our enemies
A thousand times or even more
Still they cannot make us kneel
One thousand years of constant war
The giant look for any chance
To bring down Asgaard's mighty walls
No matter what they send at us
We will never let it fall
'Cause we are
We're the Guardians

Standing firm against all odds
We are guarding Asgaard's mighty walls
We protect the realm of Asagods
No matter what they send at us
We will never let them fall
We're the Guardians
