I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shinin' through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you some time
And I want to spend some time with you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted waters all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not to those who wait to late
We got to go for all we know
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
Darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Building big castles way on high
Just the two of us, you and I
Just the two of us, let's get together, baby
Just the two of us, we can make it
Just the two of us, we can make it
Just the two of us
