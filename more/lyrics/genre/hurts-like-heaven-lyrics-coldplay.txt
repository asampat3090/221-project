Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
'Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?'
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Written up in marker on a factory sign
'I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine'
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
See the arrow that they shot, trying to tear us apart
Took the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go
You
Ooohooh
'Cause you do
Oh you, use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven
On every street, every car, every surface are names
Tonight the streets are ours and we're writing and saying
Don't let them take control
No we won't let them take control
Yes, I feel a little bit nervous,
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax,
How come they're out to get us?
How come they're out when they don't know the facts?
So on concrete canvas under cover of dark
On concrete canvas, I'll go making my mark
Armed with a spray can soul
I'll be armed with a spray can soul
You
Ooohooh
Oh, you
Ooohooh
'Cause, you
You use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven
Woho-ooh
Woho-oooh
Yeah, it's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
It hurts like heaven
