I been burning Bright
For so long I cant remember
Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I cant stay this high forever
This mans had all he can stand, time to lay this body down
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart Ive been livin in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
Dont give up on me
Sweet Annie.
Sweet Annie
I know I promised you a life
But an empty bed and the words I said dont carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, Find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and pray its not too late
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart Ive been livin in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
Dont give up on me
What will be will be
Sweet Annie.
Turn out the light
These hands alone to hold you
Fall all over you
All over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over, and over again
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart Ive been livin in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
Dont give up on me
Sweet Annie.
