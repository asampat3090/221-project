I've been trying real hard to realize
But some things take a long, long
Long, long time
Long time
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foaming at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen
Way back
Way back
Way back
Never saw my dark side, in, in your eyes
Back and forth, bloody fingers
Painting up the sky
The sky
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foaming at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen
Way back
Way back
Way back
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foaming at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen, Aberdeen
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
