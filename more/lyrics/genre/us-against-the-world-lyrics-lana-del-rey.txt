What do you need to get high for,
When your baby's so die for?
Quit your job let's make a ride for it.
If you want it supersize,
I can do that for you.
If you want it double fries,
I can do that for you.
If you wanna good surprise,
I can do that for you.
If you won't believe your eyes,
I can do that for you.
What do you need to get high for,
When your baby's so die for?
Quit your job let's make a ride for,
It's us against the world.
If you want a cola,
I can make it colder.
If you want a bad girl,
Nobody's bolder.
And if you want the Queen,
Of New York then you,
Better call me, call me.
If you want some dirty lies,
I can do that for you.
Watch me dance for other guys,
I can do that for you.
Tell you everythin's alright,
I can do that for you.
Never ever leave your side,
I can do that for you.
What do I need to get high for?
There ain't no reason to cry for.
Quit your job, let's make a life,
Boy, it's us against the world.
If you want a cola,
I can make it colder.
If you want a bad girl,
Nobody's bolder.
And if you want the Queen,
Of New York then you,
Better call me, call me.
Lights, lights,
Sights, sights.
Buy me Coca Cola,
In the middle,
Of the night.
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah.
Lights, lights,
Sights, sights.
Buy me Coca Cola,
In the middle,
Of the night.
Ah-ah, ah-ah.
