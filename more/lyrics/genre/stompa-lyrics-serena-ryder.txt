People, working every night and day
Never give yourself no time
Got too many bills to pay
Slow down, nothings gonna disappear
If you give yourself some room
To move to the music you hear
Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
People, looking for the great escape
Looking to the greener side
Trying to find a better way
Slow down; open up your big brown eyes
Feel the rhythm in your heart
You dont even need to try
Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, ohh ohh,
stompa your feet
Nothing is wrong, if you move to the beat
Clappa your hands
Stompa your feet
Stompa your feet
When you cant seem to shake off all the feelings that are breaking
Little pieces of the music thats in you
All the pain that you feel
I can prove its not real
Theres just one thing you gotta do
Gotta get up, listen to me
Clappa your hands, stompa your feet
Nothing is wrong, if you move to the beat
Clappa your hands
Stompa your feet
Stompa your feet
Stompa your feet, stompa your feet
