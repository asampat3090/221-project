Beirut
indie
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
Nobody raise their voices
Just another night in Nantes
Nobody raise their voices
Just another night in Nantes
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
